Over $8Gs. These crooks actually had the nerve to charge us $69 for 3 pills. I checked online the pills can be had for 19 cents EACH! Avoid Hospital ERs at all costs.","1":"I *adore* Travis at the Hard Rock's new Kelly Cardenas Salon!  I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \n\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \n\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \n\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!","2":"I have to say that this office really has it together, they are so organized and friendly!  Dr. J. Phillipp is a great dentist, very friendly and professional.  The dental assistants that helped in my procedure were amazing, Jewel and Bailey helped me to feel comfortable!  I don't have dental insurance, but they have this insurance through their office you can purchase for $80 something a year and this gave me 25% off all of my dental work, plus they helped me get signed up for care credit which I knew nothing about before this visit!  I highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has!","3":"Went in for a lunch. Steak sandwich was delicious, and the Caesar salad had an absolutely delicious dressing, with a perfect amount of dressing, and distributed perfectly across each leaf. I know I'm going on about the salad ... But it was perfect.\n\nDrink prices were pretty good.\n\nThe Server, Dawn, was friendly and accommodating. Very happy with her.\n\nIn summation, a great pub experience. Would go again!","4":"Today was my second out of three sessions I had paid for. Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn't even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn't stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won't be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman's behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" Admit your wrongs, but don't make your guest feel unwelcome because you can't do you job properly.","5":"I'll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta. Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, \" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?\" She does. \n\nMy hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard \"mmmm this is so good\" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone.\n\nSo-\n\nDo order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels. \n\nIf they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny. \n\nDo make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don't go with a date unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it's available.","7":"This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality\n\nMany of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.\n\nThe service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.\n\nIt's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options.","8":"I was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers. The \"Man O'War\" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. \nThe only big miss on their beers I've had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  \nNonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn't had from them would be top notch... and they are! \nThe reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! \nThe servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! \nAfter another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. \nThis is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn't seem very pleased when leaving. \nThe toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.","10":"Like walking back in time, every Saturday morning my sister and I was in a bowling league and after we were done, we'd spend a few quarters playing the pin ball machines until our mother came to pick us up.\n\nMy sister was daring and play the machines hard, she was afraid of that \"tilt\" showing up and freezing the game.  I, on the other hand was a bit more gentler and wanted to make sure I got my quarter's worth.\n\nThis place has rows and rows of machines, some are really old and some are more of a mid 80's theme.  There is even a Ms pac man!  It was fun to spend an afternoon playing the machines and remembering all the fun of my early teen years.","11":"Walked in around 4 on a Friday afternoon, we sat at a table just off the bar and walked out after 5 min or so. Don't even think they realized we walked in. However everyone at the bar noticed we walked in!!! Service was non existent at best. Not a good way for a new business to start out. Oh well, the location they are at has been about 5 different things over the past several years, so they will just be added to the list. SMDH!!!","12":"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. \nI wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. \nGive it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews. \nA bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! \nWell with it.","13":"Michael from Red Carpet VIP is amazing ! I reached out because I needed help planning my soon to be sister in law's bachelorette. It was a group of 10 girls so I was a little overwhelmed but Michael saved the day! Everything was super smooth and easy! We got good deals and had the best time ever! We booked hotel and a bachelorette package for a great price. I have saved contact info because I will for sure reach out again on next Vegas trip!!!","14":"I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.  I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).  Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.  After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.  I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.  The worst part of it was that the service.  The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).  We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.  They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out.","15":"You can't really find anything wrong with this place, the pastas and pizzas are both amazing and high quality, the price is very reasonable, the owner and the staff are very friendly, if you're in downtown check this place out, a lot of people think just because it's downtown there are lots of options around but that's not always the case as there is also a lot of poor quality food in downtown as well.","16":"Great lunch today. Staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients. We enjoyed the BBQ chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread. The biryani with chicken was also yummy! Fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens. Great addition to the fast casual scene in Cleveland.","18":"We've been a huge Slim's fan since they opened one up in Texas about two years ago when we used to live there. This place never disappoints. They even have great salads and grilled chicken. Plus they have fresh brewed sweet tea, it's the best!","20":"Our family LOVES the food here. Quick, friendly, delicious, and a great restaurant to take kids to. 5 stars!","21":"If you are looking for the best pierogies in Pittsburgh, this is your place. There are a few small tables outside but most of the business is carry out. Pierogies Plus wins Best Pierogies every year. Why? Because the owner is from Poland and she is making the real deal pierogies. The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women. \nThe biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors. They are like plump pillows of softness. You can buy them buy the dozen. You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat. The warm ones are served with butter and onions.  It's definitely a comfort food. The best part is that they ship internationally. Yes, they are that good.","22":"The food is always good and the prices are reasonable.  Although it's not exactly a restaurant -- more like a snack bar, limited menu and you walk up to the counter, place your order, wait a minute or so for them to prepare your order, and pay the cashier, then search for a table.  Kind of like a sandwich shop.  Still a much better choice for value than the other hotel Deli's on the strip.","23":"Pick any meat on the planet and the chef will make a Mexican style dish with amazing flavor! Wow, fish and lamb tacos to die for. Drinks are great as well.","24":"Great food, great service. Obviously fried chicken isn't the healthiest food on earth, but once a month I get that craving for good fried chicken. Their chicken is great, doesn't seem too fatty, and their sides are excellent too. A+","25":"PlumbSmart provided superior service from beginning to end.  They were able to repair a badly damaged sewer pipe with only one day's notice.  I was particularly pleased with their attention to care when cleaning up the landscape after the job was completed.  Their competitive pricing and excellent service make them my first stop for all future plumbing needs.  Thank you to Wayne and the whole team!\n\n-Scott B","26":"Unfortunately, I must recommend not to conduct any business with Fast Fix Jewelry and Watch Repairs.  The staff is completely unprofessional and I have never been treated so rudely in my life.  I was actually shocked and walked away thinking \"wow, how do those people even have a job?\"\n\nI have never written a negative review before, I usually chalk it up to someone having a bad day.  I have worked in customer service for 10+ years and I know it is exhausting and bad days happen.  But this is a special occasion.\n\nI drove 30 minutes to try to find someone who could help me repair a watch band.  I was barely greeted upon arrival and right away felt like I was bothering them.  The girl behind the counter obviously just wanted me to leave, the blond kid working snapped at me when I asked a question and when I re-asked in order to clarify what he said he snapped again and said, \"I already told you?!?\"  \"Is this even authentic?\"  Shouting at me over his shoulder as he work on something else. \n\nI was shocked and just stood there put my watch away awkwardly and left with no one else saying a word to me.  There are a lot of places that fix Jewelry in this city and I will be taking my business elsewhere and recommend that people reading this review do the same.  Some places, just do not deserve a loyal customer base.","27":"their pettuccine was fresh-made in the morning. it was very delicate and yummy! the owner and staffs are super kind and delightful. We also had Veal piccata. it was classic! love this restaurant.","28":"if i can give this place no stars i would, i only had their hot pot though, so im not a good judge for anything besides their shabu. i must say, quantity was small, price is expensive for the quality and quantity, and the taste of the soup base is bland as if they just put hot water in. the sauce selection is limited and not very fresh\/clean from my perspective. i love hot pot and i would never go back again because home made hot pot can be much better than this place without even trying. anyways, if you have a good appetite for hot pot, you can do yourself a favor and skip this place because it can make you miserable!","29":"This review is in regards to our experience watching SuperBowl 51 February 5, 2017 at the WestGate in the theater\/auditorium.\n\nWatch the game somewhere else.....\n\nTo those unfamiliar with The Big Game experience at WestGate you typically would get in line to watch the Superbowl in the theater portion of the hotel around 8 am on Superbowl Sunday. This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.\n\nSo at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....\n\nWe were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow.\nThat's right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.\n\nSo we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.\n\nIn summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else. We will.","30":"ended up here because Raku was closed and it received great ratings on Yelp.  I'm so glad I came here.  One of the better meals I've had.  Started off with the mushroom dish and the lettuce wrap.  both were amazing. the lettuce wrap is like having a flavor party in your mouth.  also had the panang duck which was terrific. highly recommend all three dishes. one dish that wasn't so good was the seabass with drunken noodles. overall it was an excellent meal, intimate setting, and great service. definitely will be back.","31":"I tried this place because my girls are away for a month, and I REALLY wanted to try to wait until they came back, because NOBODY can hold a candle to them, but my toes were desperate.  When I went in, they were almost twice what I usually pay to begin with.  Then, before starting the pedicure, I specifically told them I already had gel polish on my toes.  They didn't tell me right then and there \"that will be an extra $5'.  No, they waited until it was time to pay, and not only charged me for that, but they charged me all kinds of extra fees that I didn't even ask for!  I had also informed the girl that my toenail was loose and needed gluing.  While I was looking at my phone, all of a sudden I felt this sensation, and she RIPPED OFF MY TOENAIL!!!!  Without even asking me!!!!!!  So then she had another girl come and put acrylic on there since the nail underneath was only 1\/2 grown.  Again, they didn't tell me how much this would be, or even ask my permission, they just charged me at the end.  \n\nThe added stone 'massage' was barely a massage!  She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I'm used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn't even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that! \n\nUgh, I don't care HOW ugly my toes look next time, I will NEVER go anywhere else besides Bella Nails again, they ROCK!!!!!!!  This place was appalling.  I didn't want to make a scene, so I just paid the money, but I will NEVER go back!!!!!!!","32":"Love this place downtown but the Scottsdale location has no manners. Sat at bar for 10 min while bartender ignored us. No menu, no water. We walked out and they could have cared less.","33":"Best chinese resto. Highly recommended. 5 stars. Let us support this business. Best in the west valley. Trust me you wont gi wrong coming to this place","34":"Came here on a Thursday night at 6:30 p.m. My friends and I had a reservation, but it was not needed - the place was almost empty.\n\nSERVICE: Extremely Poor\n\nWhile I enjoyed the company of my friends, I would not come back to this restaurant, primarily because of the poor service. Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders. \n\nMAIN: Caprese Salad\n\nThe salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).\n\nMAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it) \n\nThese fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you visit this restaurant, I would recommend this particular dish, especially given the price ($8) and the portion size (it was quite large - almost the size of a large plate).","35":"Went here last weekend and was pretty disappointed. They did not have one thing that was pictured and recommended on yelp as being good. We started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just Ok, nothing special. My freind got the lasagna and I got some special chicken dish. They were both pretty bland and lacking that kick. Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars.","36":"This place epitomizes the rumored transformation that is in the process of taking place in Pittsburgh. Great food, drinks, and service, but the atmosphere is second to none. Definitely a must visit for locals and visitors alike! You will not feel like you're in \"Pittsburgh\".","37":"Dinner Was Fantastic! Service was great We started with the corn soup and the tuna tartare. We shared the Filet and Scallops. Both delicious entrees! We didn't realize the steak came with potatoes and ordered two sides Mac and cheese and shishito peppers. I thought the peppers were really hot but I'm a whimp I guess! We will definitely come back","38":"They keep there appointments on time and are pretty efficient. However I am very disappointed in how they think that just because I am a girl that I do not know what is going on with my car's tires. The guy that helped me out told me that my two front tires tread was extremely low and that I would be needing two new tires in a month or two. He told me that he could show me the same tires I have on there now and how much they would be. When the I had taken my car to the other Discount Tire they told me it that my tread was actually still really good for how many miles I have on my car. When he told me the price of the two tires it was around $280. Which I had just bought two new ones a couple months before that and they were the same price. So when I bought the two new tires my tire pressure light came on not that long after that. I honestly feel like the tires were not even new and did not look worth $280.","39":"Met a friend for dinner there tonight. The server only brought us one menu. After she brought us a couple of Cokes she didn't come to our table for 20 mins. After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food, so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes. The most we actually saw our server was when she hovered over us as we put the tip into the handheld credit card terminal. \n\nFood was somewhere between okay and decent. Service was somewhere between piss poor and terrible.","40":"Another solid BBQ place in Calgary. This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious. \n\nI actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey\/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood\/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.\n\nOk onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.\n\nThe portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) \n\nI bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality. \n\nThe specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead. \n\nAll in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor.","42":"I called the number provided and same day they showed up to my residence for an inspection. Was able to advise me of multiple broken and loose tiles on my roof and came out just a few days later and completed the repairs. Quoted me a good price for the repairs as well. No complaints!","43":"Party of 3 ordered the fish tacos, pork belly banh mi, corn beef hash Benedict, and bam ham. Everything was delicious, esp the pork belly banh mi. It's tender and juicy and the baguette was nicely toasted. Love the crispy fish taco too. Their compliment chips and salsa were fresh and super good and crispy. Service was excellent. Our waitress did a great job checking up on us and serving us. I really want other food options too but I'm too full. Next time i visit i will definitely come back.","44":"We had dinner at the Bellagio Buffet last night. The service was OK. Our server was great but kind of forgot about us towards the end of our visit. The food was cold. The only good thing there was the crab legs because they're suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made. The food was under a single lamp that didn't heat the food at all. We let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge. All she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief. Have no idea what actually happened though because we didn't see her after that. Half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn't that many options. I must say i rather go to the Rio buffet. For a high end casino this was a horrible experience.","45":"I really enjoyed my visit here.\nEverything was visually appealing to me.\nAmbiance was great. Food tasted amazing. Service was . No complaints at all","46":"Flat out fantastic!  Have been here twice and the croissants are the bomb. Can't wait until I can try other items. THE new breakfast spot in Ahwahtukee. The service is great as well. Family run business. Come and support them.","47":"Very nice eating environment and the food are quite nice. Very native Japanese style.","48":"notes: 1 visit, breakfast\/lunch\noverall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.\n\nhighlights: \n- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.\n- Prime rib is excellent\n- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.\n- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!\n- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.\n\nAvoid:\n- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.\n- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.","49":"I am years out from surgery with sacs and I wish I could turn back time.  He promises great things them butchers your body. I should have left my body alone. It was not bAd. I was out to perfect it.  We often talk about how he ruined a good body.  I will never forget his dirty nasty slippers coming into the operating room. I should have run from the room then.","50":"Such a unique place & a great find. Our waitress was funny, knowledgable, and did a fantastic job. The food was amazing. We will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to other couples!","51":"Best Wonton soup ever!!! Delicious food and great service. We had Chicken Satay, Roti C., Wonton soup, and one of the fried noodle and shrimp dishes. Definitely will be back!","52":"I've never experienced discrimination as I did last night at this place. I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn't because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be \"picky\" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.","53":"We had dinner here and the food was excellent and the service couldn't have been better!\nThanks Jose! \nWe will be back for sure.","54":"Absolutely love this place! I've been here many times and it never fails to impress me  the bff burger is unreal and the tsoynamis and cupcakes are amazing!! Everything is pretty much the best","55":"Here's why I don't write reviews for Chinese restaurants: I have to look up their English names... \n\nIt's so popular that I didn't try it until recently. The bubble tea here is really good. It's pricier than the one in Rose tea, but you also get more. \nI like that noodles with pork sauce. I've tried both the thin and wide\/thick noodles. The wide one is less chewy and are kind of sticky. I prefer the thin one for this dish.\nDan dan noodles are different from what I was expecting. My friend liked it but it's just okay for me.\nThe noodle with wonton is flavorless to me. \nThe soup dumplings are good but not amazing. If you've never had it before, give it a try and you probably will like it.\nI'd like to try noodles with beef soup next time.\n\nThe appetizers are too pricy in my opinion. I won't pay $6 for a small plate of vegetables again...\n\nThe owner is a nice guy and I enjoyed chatting with him a little bit during dinners.","57":"Took my kids here to hang out on one fine 72 degree sunny Saturday in February. Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.\n\nToo bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for. \n\nThe playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings! \n\nAfter a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the \"nice stuff\" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, \"Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?\" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.\n\nAfter carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff. \n\nSo, yeah, im not worried about coming back to this place any time soon in this lifetime. (You think?). Lol. Maybe as a duck.","58":"There is a reason I frequent Paul's Ace over the big names such as Home Depot or Lowes: the personalized assistance. Do the big name brands provide this? Yes, bit not at the same level Paul's Ace Hardware does in Tempe. If I need help, they are ready and willing to help me in every aspect of my project.\n\nThe store manager Bras personally went out if his way to assist me in gathering all the materials I needed for my current project. He knows his store, bounced around to show me all options, and seemed to have recommendations on each project. This guy must love what he does because he knows everything in the store (or he is a constant do-it-yourselfer).\n\nI am always pleased with the help I receive and am thankful this place is in my neighborhood.","60":"Sadly this place has been sold.  The gas prices have sky rocketed, some of the long term staff is gone, lottery is gone, they have run out of popular cigarettes, I tried to get gas a few days ago and the vendors \/ delivery trucks that used to park on the side street or off to the side were parked at the pumps...I am going to give it a little time and see if it gets better.  I have been going to this store for 15+ years, but if it doesn't shape up, I will find another....","61":"Easily entering my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte after just one visit!\n\nPork Belly, unreal! Had an AMAZING prime NY Strip with bourbon butter jam, PHENOMENAL!","62":"So good! They didn't make it to 5 stars due to the prices are a bit high for the amount of food and the location is a bit unsavory. \nThe decor and atmosphere was surprisingly nice, from the outside I expected to be more run down inside. The staff was very nice. We were surprised how empty the dining room was for a Friday evening.\nWe got Vegetable Samosas to start then ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, rice and plain Naan. Our only complaint was the lamb could've been more tender but everything was flavorful and delicious. \nI would definitely go again if given the chance.","63":"Employees were to busy chatting with each other. One employee had his head out the  drive thru window talking to people the entire time I was there. The cook come from outside and made my food. Did he was hands before making my food???","64":"This random hole in the wall is located in the Park Rd. shopping center.  I had never heard of it until that fateful St. Patricks day when another beer was in order.  After making my way there and enjoying the patio, I decided the food was my next venture.\n\nAfter my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.  \nTher service is great and they can accomadate large groups, the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.  Great staff, awesome menu choices, I'll be going back","65":"((( LADIES BEWARE))) Don't ever take your machine to 35th Ave. sew and vac on Northern they broke my Elna machine while it was being repaired. I've spent over $10.000 at their store over the years and have been a long time customer .. Bill the owners son was so rude to me and did nothing to resolve my broken machine. I was disgusted when Bill the owners daughter wouldn't do Any thing to help me when the repair man broke my machine. It's terrible to bring a nice sewing machine in to be repaired and these people broke it while in their possession and they don't want to do a damm thing about it. It was like a big (screw you) to me. I won't buy another thing from these people for the way I was treated. Even the material is too over priced. I'm in the market for another machine but I won't go there ever again. My machine STILL NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT RESOLVED THIS ISSUE. ITS STILL BROKEN AND IT HAPPENED WHILE REPAIRMAN WAS SERVICING MY MACHINE. I WISH I HAD NEVER TAKEN MY MACHINE TO 35TH AVE SEW AND VAC SHOP. WHY CANT PEOPLE OWN UP TO TAKE OWNERSHIP TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN MISTAKES!!!! GO TO KINGS SEWING MACHINES MUCH BETTER SERVICE AND THEY DONT BREAK YOUR MACHINE!!!!!","66":"Great tanning salon near me, and clean, equipped with the latest tech and easy checkin and out spot for a short yet amazing relaxation and sunbathing time in chilli Cleveland. I am going to be obsessed with this place in winters and will recharge myself with vitamin D!","67":"Th service here is very hit or miss... Sometimes the staff is personable and attentive. Other times I ask myself, \"Why do I come here???\" The staff often has the  \"GTFOH\" stamp placed permanently across their foreheads, and we as patrons just have to go with it, otherwise we are deemed \"that guy.\"  I would say that my continuos visits were for the great HH, but there are several other options close to home, with the same food and drink options for me to choose from. I think today may be last visit...","68":"Great cocktails and very good food.  Overall first class restaurant.","69":"I took my wife out for a Birthday dinner with my daughter on 12-16-14  at Alfonsos.  I heard the food was good and it was and my waitress ( Dawn ) was also good ( even with it being very busy ). The problem I have is some of the waitress staff are rude. I had a gift card\/ certificate to pay for dinner. After a few minutes, a big blond waitress came over and said  ( in a loud and rude tone ) I couldn't use it cause I needed to spend $100.00 in order to get $50.00 off. She then insulted me by saying (so the tables around me could hear ) couldn't I read the fine print telling me of requirements to use gift card. I showed her the certificate and the fine print was not legible She told me, sorry that's not our fault it's yours and she walked away. I am having second thoughts about going back to use gift card. I may give it away or toss it out.","70":"This company tried deliver flowers to our home- my son was home by himself and called me.  I had him keep me on the phone while he opened the front door (our security screen door was  locked though).  He told the gal that he was not going to open the door, that his mom (me) was on the phone and he asked the driver to call me, his mom.  The driver was very insistent about getting a signature and became argumentative.  My son kept saying, call my mom, she's on the phone now.  And she kept interrupting and insistent on a signature.  I told my son to close the door.  I then called the company and spoke with a Manager, Sara.  She understood my concern and said she would make sure the driver was trained on these situations.  Three days pass and I still don't have my flowers or a phone call.  I called and spoke with Sara and she had a completely different tone with me than previously.  She was very curt and tried to give me lots of excuses. I asked that the Owners call me.  Five days later, I've never received a call back from the Owner or my flowers.  I called to find out when one of the Owners would call back, and Linda told me it would be by Friday, which meant six days later than my initial request.  I told Linda that was pretty unreasonable and she told me that the Owners are busy and have several other businesses.  In my opinion, that's completely unacceptable- do yourself a favor and do not order from this Company.  They are very unprofessional and not very concerned about customer service.","71":"Heard about this place and was dying to check it put-and I'm very glad I did! Decent beer selection and kind of a hipster vibe, but $8 for a loaded hot dog and tater tots has got to be one of the best deals in town. Tons of unique toppings to pick from and delicious dipping sauces for tots (secret fry sauce was my fav). We were there early and had no problem getting a seat at the bar, but I can see how during prime time or when live music is on how it could be kind of tight. If you're going for the food is get there earlyu because that loaded dog would have been super hard to eat while standing.","72":"received a  mailer and thought okay let's go. walked in on a Monday afternoon greeted by a bartender wearing a cute  t shirt that said the bar and below that the baby. how cute however never got her name. looked over menu asked what was good she said the club. so ordered it and  yes it is good. had a beer a club on white toast served with fries and watched sport center. really felt at ease there and good music playing. will go back again.","73":"Met an old close friend for dinner at Portofino.  Great intimate dinning with class. Excellent pasta and meat dishes. Delightful service and great drinks. Will come back!","74":"My company hosted a dinner and awards night at the hotel last night and the experience was the best we could have imagined! Working with Kristine Cole was fantastic and the communication was always on point. I walked in to be blown away by the set up and I had compliments on the food all night. I came into work today to be flooded with emails on how impressed everyone was with the presentation. The staff that was there to help us was GREAT! I believe Tim was in charge and he had Anna and one other gentleman with him and they made us laugh and gave us the privacy we needed. We will be back and I will be recommending them to everyone!","75":"Yes... the Boba Tea explosion is in full force. I have been to Lee Lee International Supermarket in Chandler many times, but I never noticed this little gem next to it until a couple years ago. Boba Tea House has serving up some of the best boba tea in the Valley long before it became a big thing. They have a fantastic array of flavors and drink choices to choose like fruit slushes, snow, milk tea, pudding, mango jelly, coffee jelly, etc. They even have snacks like popcorn chicken, fried tofu, and fries. The staff is super friendly and the prices are reasonable. I still laugh at my friends who have no idea what Boba Tea is or are too afraid to suck up one of those chewy ball things. LOL. In case you didn't know, Boba Tea is a flavored tea (usually with milk) to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. I think they are super delicious. Today I got the Blueberry Milk Boba Tea and it made for the perfect snack in the middle of my day. Another favorite of my mine is the honeydew milk tea.","76":"Yum!! Had the kale grits and would definitely have those again! Menu choices are unique, farm fresh and delicious!","78":"ooooooh yummy.  i'm a red meat eating midwestern girl, and 9 had the best steak i can remember having in....who knows how long, it was DAMN GOOD.  the mac and cheese is a tasty, tasty side.  try the snicker dessert...it's basically two cookie\/ice cream sanwiches with bits of snickers.  the s'mores my sister got were super fun too.  only complaint is that it was really loud and waaaaaaay too many annoying veil-toting bachelorette parties for my taste.  but hey, it is the palms.","79":"Dreadful Service\n\nI've had Jimmy John's before several years ago in Minneapolis.. But apparently here in Phoenix, the store personnel must be trained differently. I had to take my sandwich back up to the counter twice to get the thick headed folks working at the one on Camelback at about 16th to get my sandwich the way I wanted it.\n\nI asked for a #10 Hunter's Club with all the veggies. What I got was the standard #10 Hunters Club with lettuce and tomatoes. \n\nAfter seeing that, I took it back up to the counter, and explained that I wanted all the veggies. They explained to me that those were all the veggies the sandwich came with. I carefully explained that I wanted all of the veggies that they have. The guy said, oh, you want the Freebies. I would have thought he would have clarified when I ordered whether I just wanted everything that came on the sandwich, or the Freebies as well. I said yes, I wanted all of the Freebie Veggies. \n\nI took my revised sandwich and sat down to eat it, only to find that along with the veggies I had requested, they had piled on Italian vinaigrette and Dijon mustard, which I did NOT want.","80":"These burgers are phenomenal! The Galley Boy just melts in your mouth, and paired with the potato teasers and a milkshake it is like heaven on Earth.","81":"I got stuck in Myrtle Beach last week and stayed here waiting for another flight.  Very clean, comfortable and right near the airport.  I would definitely stay again.","82":"#1 it should be advertised as a vegetarian dinner. For the price we paid, I really would have liked a nice cut of meat. \n#2. Way over priced. Dinner for 2 with (2) blue moon beers and (1) $10 glass of wine... $165+tip. We tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the Dark was a pretty interesting experience. \n#3. The food was Meh... I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others, but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace. \nAll in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal... Be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!!\n*** also if they don't like your review on their Facebook page they will block you from commenting on other people talking crap about you, they can not handle the truth and allow others to put you down ***","83":"First off food is DELICIOUS! By far my favorite restaurant in downtown Phoenix. I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints, but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second, the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter, will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor! He constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much). He made the experience at the Arrogant Butcher memorable!","84":"At least the Pinks concession stand by Section 3.  Unqualified servers who don't tell you that they won't take cash - and they seriously won't take cash.  Then the manager wouldn't even take the cash to another register. The lines are stupid \nlong and the workers incapable of handling the slightest issue. I m sitting upstairs if there is a next time I come to a Knights game.","85":"Wonderful experience. We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!","86":"I was told so many great things about this place but my entire experience was awful. The food wasn't very good, way too greasy. My fries were luke warm and my tray was literally covered in grease. I needed about 50 napkins and a shower after that. The service was pretty awful too. I can't believe I paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings. On national cheeseburger day of all days too. Such a disappointment and I've never gone back since. Best thing about it was the soda, but that's pretty difficult to mess up.","87":"Came here for the \"midnight\" launch of the PSVR. After previously being told by another employee a week prior to get there at 6:01PM to get one of the six extra systems that weren't pre-ordered, and that it was first come first serve, I ended up not able to get a system. When I came in yesterday, the woman behind the counter told me they had written down names and numbers of people who wanted one a few days prior, and that they all were accounted for. \n\nThe previous employee even told me I was the first person to have asked about it. If they were organized, and told ALL their employees customers could put their names down on a PSVR, I could have gotten a system last night.\n\nNot only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at GameStop, but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away, and lines were already forming at each location). \n\nNot happy.","88":"This place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. \n\nMy favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello, the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka, Lasagna, or Ravioli.\n\nMario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks. \n\nPlus to top it off, when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues, Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons. \n\nGet the idea? It's all good at this neighborhood gem!","89":"Dr.K. & Dr.B. together with their Agape team are caring, professional, thorough and knowledgeable.\nDr.K. & Dr.B. will holistically bring your health & well being back into balance, not just treat individual injuries.\nEach visit is carefully tailored to your current state of being and needs.","90":"Man, I love Toronto! Hiding in a strip mall on Overlea, find a dingy looking restaurant that serves up fantastic, cheap kabob...be warned regardless of when you come here you'll likely be waiting for a table as this place is always overrun with people...If you're a fan of perfectly grilled spicy meat, you must try this place out...now that I've been here I need to limit how many times I go here per month :)\n\nTake the drive out and have some kabob...if you don't own a car, borrow one or get a zipcar membership...totally worth it!","91":"Today was my first time seeing the staff at Bella Smile and it was a great experience.  Although I'm not currently living in Las Vegas I plan on coming back for checkups and any other problems that may arise.  There was no wait time whatsoever and I was out of there without a drop of pain or discomfort.  The manager Severn was very accommodating and will be getting business from my family and friends in town.","92":"I've taken my kids here several times, and we've never had to wait more then 5 minutes. We go right up, sign in, and they usually call us back right as I'm done signing their paperwork. The doctors have always been super nice. My daughter had stitches done, and she was a nervous wreck. The staff tried so hard to make her comfortable and gave her a stuffed toy when she was done. It was very nice. I wish they would open a bit earlier in the day...otherwise, they're great.","93":"One of the crappier Marriotts I've ever stayed at. The staff is nice and professional enough. But the fact that it's right by the frontage road along I-17, you tend to attract a seedier crowd. Also, with three floors worth of rooms here, guess how many washer\/dryer they have for everyone? ONE crappy washer and ONE crappy dryer! Don't even think about washing your clothes on a Friday night. For a two hour period, I went to see if the washer was finally available, each time I was met with yet another load of dirty clothes inside. If they can't afford to get more machines, consider installing one of those number ticket dispensers! Just a thought. Maybe I would have a better shot of washing my clothes. I also considered sitting on top of the washer until the load was done, but that would be kind of creepy on my part. I will be packing all my dirty clothes with me and never come back here again.","95":"Love the crust on this pizza. The sauce is decent, cheese is okay, the pepperoni was not the best quality. \nMy friend ordered an everything slice, said it was good, just wished so cheese was on the toppings to hold it together.","96":"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.\n\nFirst, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.\n\nI expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. \n\nTo top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.","97":"I'm not that familiar with Scottsdale so I'm just guessing that this restaurant is fairly new. The atmosphere is great and lively but s but loud. They have a huge wine and drink list. \n\nThe food was really good, I highly recommend the ahi tuna appetizer, ravioli and the skirt steak!","98":"\"Good morning, cocktails for you?\" \nWait...what? Oh...it's Vegas!\n\nDining here, you best not be dieting because this place is literally the definition of excess, but in a good way. I'm a sucker for benedicts so that was awesome. \nService was really great too and the staff was so welcoming. It was our first stop just after landing so really appreciate the service.\n\nBack in Hawaii this reminds me of Zippys or Anna Millers - that home feeling. Prices are a bit high, but for what you get it's totally worth it. Will remember this place if I ever return to Vegas in the future.","99":"Hands down best Bloody Mary ever. So many things in my BM, veggies  mmm bacon.  \"Nailed it\" it's an appetizer. I also had the burger with fries. Who knew fries could be so good. The presentation doesn't disappoint ether. Very nice. Great seating outside although we sat inside. Would love to see this restaurant near my hometown. Seriously. Get the BM. You rock Guy!","100":"They charged me twice what I expected to pay. The guy at the counter small-talked me, asked me if I wanted \"any additional insurance\" - I said no - and just initialed where he told me to, not noticing that one thing I initialed was collision waiver insurance, which I did not need and ended up doubling the original cost. He did not walk me through the additional cost and may even have been purposely misleading by distracting me with small talk. I am an experienced traveler and nothing like this has happened to me before. When I returned the car and expressed my surprise at the doubled cost they essentially said \"well you signed it\" and \"it's worth it anyway.\" I will never rent from this Payless again.","101":"Quiet bar and grill great waitress and the margarita pizza was very good. Small sign out front and almost missed the place.","102":"They came out when they said they would, did the job in the amount of time they said it would take for the amount they said it would cost. They sold me exactly what I needed to hopefully keep my basement from flooding and didn't try to sell me a bunch of things I didn't need, subsequently their quote was 1\/3 of those other waterproofing guys and I'm willing to bet my basement will stay dry just as long! Thanks to Nick's crew!\nThe O'Donnells","103":"This is my first yelp.  This restaurant was soo good I felt compelled to yelp about it.  Went for dinner with a friend of mine, really nice space.  All the staff were amazing!!  The chef even came out to our table which was cool.  And the Food, well I think even the most discerning top chef judges would be impressed.  A++ across the board.  We had the tenderloin and mac and cheese.  As well as the tomatoes two ways both are excellent choices.  I can't wait to go back.  Cielo, kudos.","105":"PRC consulted on 2 tile roof replacements at apartment communities we manage in the greater Phoenix area. PRC was thorough and caught a number of items the roofer needed to correct on both jobs. Their communication was great. A roof is a major investment and having a professional help manage installation is money well spent.\n\nThe specific services provided were initial condition and spec reports and roughly 5 job inspections per property.","106":"Awful place. Staff is not nice, very rude.  They never seem to want to help at all..Their service is not up to par & always out of bagels","107":"So many great this about Yoga Factory! Excellent teachers, very friendly and professional; they have been very patient with my practice but know how to push me to meet my goals. Amazing location very easily accessible very easy city parking! Nice large space in the hot room, never did I feel like my elbow room was compromised and the room can get PACKED! The facility is clean, neat and I love the choice of decor. Highly recommended for a first-timer or for someone who has a frequent practice very friendly and welcoming place.","108":"I have no idea what the owner's problem is, but he's incredibly rude. His wife, on the other hand is super nice (an odd mix).\n\nGreat space, rude owner and the coffee is average.","109":"I used to work food service and my manager at the time recommended I try Defalco's. He knows food well so I was excited to try one of his favorites spots.\n\nThis place is really, really good. Lot of authentic Italian choices and they even have a grocery section with tons of legit Italian goodies. I had a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich that was to die for. Anytime my ex-manager comes back to town (he left for Vegas and I think he misses Defalco's more than anything else in the valley), he is sure to stop by and grab his favorite grub.\n\nParking is a bit tricky during busy hours and the wait times for food can get a bit long, so I recommend calling your order ahead of time (unless you want to take a look around while you wait, first-timers).","110":"Early this past January, I needed to find a furnished rental in the uptown Charlotte market. I really had no idea of how or where to look. I was glad when I found the Sold on Charlotte site.\nAs I recall I traded a few emails and phone calls with Chip and he was helpful in answering all my questions. We met at 626 North Graham and he showed me the unit there that was available.\nBetween Chip and Sylvia, I was \"sold\" on that apartment and we got the \"paperwork\" going. I enjoyed my stay there which lasted 6 months (3 months more that I initially signed up for).\nWhen it came time to give my notice, Sylvia gave me all the details I needed, and these were pretty much the same that were in our initial Lease Agreement. They were kind enough to give me ample notice to show the apartment during my last 30 days, without too much inconvenience. Sylvia helped me tie up a few loose ends and even arranged to pick up a lamp for me that needed to be repaired when I moved out.\n \nI would certainly reach out to the team at Sold on Charlotte again.\n \nKind regards,\n \nJohn D","111":"I really enjoyed coming here, it located near walnut st which meant parking was difficult. \n\nWhat I didn't realized was that hot pots where individualized. They gave a pot over an electric hot plate which you can adjust the temp. They also have hot water on the side in case you run out. Very fulfilling for $15.\n\nIt's a small area and they also have a section for you to customize your own sauces.","112":"Ok so I have purchased items from RC Wiley and have spent a lot of money but will never again. I had a $500 credit limit after I purchased my fridge and when  iwent to use it towards ny bed room purchase it was no longer available due to me paying it off too soon????? (Apparently since I paid $500 in 2months instead of $25 in 10 months) When we attempted to question what they meant and if there was anything that couldbe done the supervisor emele pretty much told us to take a flying leap -are you serious!!  So I spent my $2300 at Ashley furniture. RC Wiley apparently is balling and they don't need me to buy anything. Good luck! when u have poor customer service reps representing you like that their making your company look bad.","113":"Let me start by saying that I love Aveda which is why I decided to try this salon... and it was a big mistake. I explained what I wanted to the stylist, and even showed two photos. It's easy to get this cut wrong since it's short hair, so I also showed a photo of what exactly I DID NOT want. She asked what I didn't like about the photo and I explained it (it's a section in the back and she acted like she understood). The cut finishes, she spins me around and it is literally EXACTLY what I showed her that I didn't want. I was mortified and now trying to grow this hideous cut out. Nothing is blended and she butchered my hair. And to make matters worse, she wasn't even friendly! Heading to a different salon today to try and get it fixed.","114":"Place took forever... Come to find out that they didn't have my oil filter and a hour and a half into me waiting the Napa parts guy pulls up and 10 mins later it was done... Hmmm.. But they didn't even let me know what was going on! Never going back","115":"Cutest little dive bar in the city! Chill vibe, cheap (and yummy) drinks, delicious food, and family owned. Laura was an excellent bartender and made us feel right at home. Bonus points because it looks like a cute little house! A must-see if you're in the area.","116":"Really happy to have such a unique place like this in Phoenix. The Tea was tasty and the interior is very well laid out. Will definitely come back!","117":"These darn Northerners really know how to make some goooood eggplant. I am obsessed, like seriously obsessed with their eggplant minced pork dish. it sounds so simple but never have I had it this good. Everything else on the menu is decent, the dumplings, XLB, noodles, etc., but the eggplant is to die for! Go for the authentic side of the menu avoid the Americanized dishes.","118":"the few times i ordered from here i was greatly disappointed. freezer burned strawberry ice cream, microwaved food and run of the mill breakfast.","119":"We have had a wonderful experience with Dr. Beals treating our son. He's been seeing him for about 8 months now and are very satisfied with the care he receives here. Dr. Beals is very helpful, we never feel rushed to get out of his office and he's patient in answering our questions. One of the things I most appreciate is that I've never felt like his solution is to throw a bunch of meds at my son. He's conservative and has started on low doses, moving up only when we were comfortable. My son loves coming to the appointments and playing with all the Minecraft toys in his office!","120":"Just ok. Not a fun true busy dim sum place and I'm so sure they don't make their own food. Won't be back soon.","121":"I've been coming to Loco on mill since they opened. I love coming here especially on Sundays for football. They have all the games on, great bloodys, and awesome breakfast!  Loco is my local watering hole and I always have a great time with the staff.","122":"Ordered combo 3.  It comes with two plates or rice (or bread), one skewer of chicken breast kebob, one skewer of koobideh, one skewer of barg kebob, 3 grilled tomatoes, a plate of parsley and sliced radish, a bunch of basil.  No salad.\n\nThe meat were all very flavourful, not dry and juicy!!! The taste was very good.   Definitely a lot of food for two people. :)\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive.  \n\nI read another review that they do not accept amex, and yeah they really don't.  But I asked before I paid for the meal so it's ok.","123":"Rebel doesn't take credit cards and charges you to use debit. Not very convenient for people going to the lake. We will just fill up elsewhere. \nThe place is filthy, too.","125":"Hey....i just want to say, everytime I eat here, since the late 90's.  Nothing but good wings, good beer, and good times.  If the waiting staff is terrible, slow, non attentive, so be it.  I eventually get my food and beer, im busy either catching up with friends or pull out the cell phone and chat with friends.  Weird but there it is.  Have Fun here..........Cheers!","126":"While the prices are a bit high for a make-your-own pizza, the taste makes up for it. I love going to Seventh Street market, sitting Not Just Coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from Pure.  I've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market, and I can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated. So try to eat it fresh while there if possible.\n\nIf one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you, go for it, as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money.  I wanted what I wanted, though, so I ended up with a medium, thin crust, regular crust pizza with jalapenos, pepperoncini, onions and feta.  It was pretty expensive at $2\/topping = $20 med pizza. But it was delicious.\n\nThe arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to-die-for. I crave that dressing days later. So light and fresh but flavorful.","128":"Not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point. My girlfriend and I had dinner there last night, with reservations set for 6 p.m., were seated by 6:05. Our server William was awesome, was fast, attentative and really was one of the best servers we've encountered and we dine out a lot. We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh, hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound. \n\nThe only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside, May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top. I just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable. \n\nMy girlfriend and I will definitely be returning to pickle bills, we had a fantastic evening. Last thing to note, the service was great even though the place was packed!","129":"After being a HUGE fan of the Mission I decided to try this place out seeing that it's owned by the same owners even though I was very skeptical that it could possibly be as great. To my surprise it lived up to what others had told me. The ambiance was amazing. Very much like the mission. Candles light up the entire place. The outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available. The staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu. My favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the Apple caramel upside down cake. They were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. They have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine:) This is a great date night spot that I recommend it now to all my friends.","130":"I've tried to shop at Montblanc Toronto several times but the selection is very limited and the sales staff while attentive, not very friendly. Recently I tried to replace a ring I received as a gift and lost.  The Toronto store was quick to identify the style number of the ring but said they no longer had stock and couldn't help me, I asked them if they could check other locations with no avail.  \n\nBecause the ring had a lot of sentimental value I decided to call the  Hong Kong location where the ring was purchased. Over the phone the clerk, Jane, and amazing representative knew the ring as well and again it was out of stock but she offered to check with head office in to see if any exist  at any location world wide.  She called me the next day from Hong Kong to inform me she found the last ring in London and it was now in transit to her store where she would hold it for me until I return to Hong Kong in a few months.  Not wanting to risk the ring getting sold or lost, I paid for it with my credit card over the phone and arranged for a friend to pick it up and send it by courier.  The ring now sits on my finger never to be removed again :)...  This is the type of service that builds loyalty.  \n\nThe Montblanc store in Hong Kong is located in Pacific Mall. Jane has since been promoted and transferred to their flagship store on Kowloon Side on Canton Road. I'm not surprised of her promotion given the service she provided me.  I will be forever be loyal to the Hong Kong location. Thanks Jane!  I'm giving 2 stars to the Toronto location, the Hong Kong location would easily have 5 stars.","131":"Tr\u00c3\u00a8s bon poulet avec la petite sauce piquante c'est succulent .

Love the mango curry especially and everything. They have great bubble tea too. Very nice service very polite.","133":"We've shopped there for several years and always enjoyed the savings but this year I'm shopping for hoodies for the less fortunate.  Thank you Antigua.","134":"What an awesome pool party!!! I wish there was a tad more interactive aspects. I want hot girls and guys spraying champagne all over us or dancing with us.","135":"I LOVE this place! I have found the staff to be extremely knowledgable, beyond helpful and always willing to go above and beyond to do whatever they can to assist you. This store carries products that I can't find anywhere else besides online. They are great about returns if you have a finicky eater (like mine). \nI also love that they have no agenda when it comes to helping you select a certain food. They listen to what you're looking for and then make suggestions based on the info you've given them. They're also well versed in the latest pet food recalls (which are hard to stay on top of these days!)\nIf you sign up online, they offer discounts and specials all the time which helps with some of the pricier food. Organized, clean, and a huge selection. I have absolutely no complaints about this place... Except maybe that when they hold weekend pet adoptions I get depressed that I can't take all the animals home.","136":"I just had a terrible experience with Dr. Jennifer Vonya-Novak's front office.  I changed my primary care to Dr. Novak.  It took me 3 weeks to get an appointment because she ONLY DOES 4 NEW PATIENTS A DAY.  I waited the 3 weeks for what I was told was a 7:45 am appt.  I got to her office at 7:45 (actually 7:47 am according to my cell phone).  The door was locked and the office hours posted were 8:00- to 5:00.  I could see through the glass doors that there wasn't anyone at the desk area.  l left ,went home and called a 8 am, no answer.  Called again at 8:10 and the lady said I missed my appointment and could not be seen today.  She argued that the door is always open at 7:45.  She was unapologetic and offered me a next day appointment, like she was doing me a favor since I \"MISSED\" my appointment.  She kept calling me \"my dear\" as if I was incapable of knowing the appointment time.  I found her very condescending.  Needless to say, I will not be going to Dr. Novak and will let my friends know the office procedures there and the unbendable and arrogant rules!","137":"I love Pizza, but I try to stay away for dietary reasons. I went here last week with my daughter and mom, and was pleasantly surprised. Thin crust New York style pizza at a good price. The menu is kind of simple, but that's the way these places are nowadays. Friendly staff and clean simple surroundings.","138":"Was very excited for happy hour and heard great things. Food was less then average we were charged $10 for BREAD.  Most apps were greasy or fried and still spent $250 on happy hour menu for a group of 4. First review on yelp so cared enough to take the time to write this. Sorry won't come back.","139":"Excellent shortbread.  Koodos to Ms. Mary and her oh so good chocolate crunch shortbread cookies.","140":"My family and I came in on Wed. Night for dinner we had a party of 6 plus a baby(using a high chair). We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall, half booth half chairs. My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said \"No\" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced.\nThe worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in. We live 3 1\/2 hours from Mesa and it's so disappointing to run into this kind of service, this was definitely not a pleasant experience","141":"Five stars! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!","142":"Oooh momma!\nThe flavor is strong with this one.\nClean, fast, friendly everytime. But not weird and sterile like Baja Fresh.\nGlad they're open again!","143":"LK is a great technician! He makes you feel relaxed and comfortable, as well as being extremely attentive to your nails.","144":"Oh. My. Gosh. I'm not going to write much except that it was DELICIOUS. I came here because of all the reviews and seriously it was worth the drive. I had the spring rolls and those were delicious. Then I had the noodle ye-saw with shrimp. And I pretty much licked my plate. And all the plates going by looked better and better. I'm already planning the next time I come here. And my server was a sweet sweet girl. Soft spoken but just the perfect server. I'd take a picture of my food but I dove in and cleaned my plate. Lol. Oh well. There are 254 pics for you to choose from.","146":"Amazing!!! Clean and pretty! Best service I've been in Las Vegas! Everyone are so nice! And all the design are perfect","147":"Amazing place, full of authentic decor and ambiance! Papaya salad is so refreshing and full of flavor. Combination pad thai with pork beef and shrimp is enough for two meals.  Thai toasts for an appetizer consists if minced chicken and shrimp baked on toast served with cucumber salad. It us a must try!!","149":"I work at Wells Fargo right next door to rubio's on 24th st and baseline and out main goal is too satisfy the customers using our vision and values. That being said rubios is so relative because everyday I go to rubios for lunch they make me feel at home and like a valued customer by showing quality service and going over and beyond the standard for me! They don't sale chimichangas but the manager George and the great cooks took it upon themselves to fry my burrito for me! George is a great leader and represents that franchise at a high level! Last but not least Priscilla the shift leader, lights up the whole room with her smile as soon as you are opening the door, as well delivering excellent service! Thanks rubios - DA'QUON  #YOURBANKTELLER","150":"Wiki Wiki is like the middle ground from your typical gas station auto wash and full service washes with the personal touch.\n\nYou start out by ordering your service at one of 3 electronic kiosks.  Everything is touch screen. They give you 4 choices but then they suggest additional upgrades to your wash.  You pay and then move on to the wash.  Someone assists you in getting your car lined up in the track.  Put your car in neutral and in a few minutes your car moves through the wash and you come out the other end.  \n\nWhen you come out, you have the option of using one of several free vacuum which are powerful.\n\nThis is a great alternative to the full service places.  It's quicker and you don't have to wait for someone to towel dry your car.","151":"PLEASE. Read this before you buy a session with her. About a year ago I bought a groupon here and having a horrible experience I've never used groupon for services again.\n\nYou get what you pay for - and in this case, less. Lesson learned.\n\nShe uses clumps of lashes that fall off within 12 hours. Your eyes will also be completely bloodshot from whatever glue she uses. I let her know and even sent pictures of my eyes because they were so red and painful I thought they were infected. She blamed it on me and offered to \"fix\" them for more money. I declined - there was no way I was letting her do any more damage. I have had my lashes done before and since with professionals and have never had that happen. I love the lash service at wishful winking and the spot in Liberty village. \n\nIcing on the badlashes cake: she was over an hour and a half late for my apt and claimed it was never booked. even when I showed her the text she had sent me with the confirmation.  The whole time I was waiting my gut was yelling NO and I should have listened.\n\nJust no.","152":"We used Creative Bridal for our Vegas wedding at MGM Grand as part of our wedding package. Originally it was only to get my husband tuxedo for the wedding. Unfortunately, my wedding dress from David's had an alteration issue and the back of my dress ripped when I was finally trying it on for the last time the day before the wedding. Since we were on our way to get a tux fitting for my husband he thought it would be best to ask them if they can help us fix it because I was in tears since the dress was ripped so bad that my butt was hanging out. Britney picked us up at MGM and brought us and during conversation she did say let's look at the dress and see what can be done. Kelly and Brittany did just that, they quickly placed me in my dress while Taisha took my husband in to get his tux fitted. All while making sure he didn't see me. I'm so grateful for all three ladies! I highly recommend them! (Sorry if I got anyone names wrong)","153":"Well they definitely lost me as a customer! RC Willey here I come!\n\nMy father, who is 69 years old, moved out here from Los Angeles the beginning of this month to be closer to me and my kids. I ordered and fully paid for a bedroom set for him. They called me like 4 days before the order was to be delivered to confirm the appointment. I advised the lady that no one was living in my father's apartment yet but if they could call me as they are on their way I could rush down to the place and open the door for them. I mean I live in the same complex so it wouldn't be a long wait! She said she would let the guys know but no promise...okaaaaay? I paid $1,200 for furniture, I am a repeat customer, and you can't make one quick easy courtesy call? Well I missed their delivery and no call was made. I found out from my LANDLORD that they came because they went to the office and he was going to let them in but they said no because someone had to sign the paper. To top it off, when I got my dad's key to check the place out before he arrived, there was a note on the COUNTER that said \"Sorry we Missed you\"....so they entered the apartment and left the note but couldn't put the damn furniture together?? They denied going in but how the hell did the paper get on the counter? Anyway my dad arrived with NO furniture and we had to pay $50.00 for them to deliver the furniture again 3 DAYS LATER. My father has bad arthritis and basically no cartilage in his knees making it very hard for him to get up from low areas such as couches and FLOORS which he almost had to sleep on if it weren't for my friend who let us borrow her air mattress luckily. He still couldn't get up though and crawled to get around his place until I was able to get to his place after work :(. Bottom line, they are not for their customers at all and their attitude after you purchase their crap shows it all. I will never be back.","154":"I have been getting monthly massages here for the past five months. A couple of the therapists are good, and some lack experience. As a stocking stuffer for my husband, I scheduled an appointment for him to meet with Roberta, a very capable therapist. When he arrived for his appointment, his name did not show on the schedule. Yet the gentleman working the front desk clearly remembered scheduling that appointment with me. He blamed it on glitchy new scheduling software. I was extremely disappointed and embarrassed, since it was a gift. But what else could we do but reschedule? An appointment was set, again with Roberta, through the same desk attendant, for this afternoon. When my husband arrived this afternoon, he was placed with a different therapist, who confessed that she did not know how to work with his specific shoulder issue. So he again rescheduled. This is getting ridiculous, and I'm considering canceling my membership over it.","156":"A toned down version of the king street location, GotStyle is a great store primarily for the service you receive.\n\nIt's definitely not for everyone - there is a price tag attached. But if you shop at places like Holt Renfrew or even the Bay then this place is considerably better in my opinion.  The reason - the sales agents are just better. They have pretty good sales twice a year, which is when I tend to go but sizing is obviously an issue at those times. I appreciate that they carry various price points in the mid to high range.  \n\nOverall, I wouldn't get my formal wear from here. That's just me personally. I'd rather go to the U.S. and pay half the price for the same quality. But if you can't do that, they have an excellent selection and great tailors. You can find cheaper tailors in Toronto, but at least at GotStyle you don't have to go through the hassle of finding the right tailer. You can trust the store. \n\nThey have an excellent selection of casual clothing and interesting and cool clothing pieces too. \nThis is definitely a go to place if you're anything like me and don't know how to buy jeans. My last visit at the store, Jannette spent a great deal of time educating my friend and I on how to dress. We left the store uncharacteristically self aware of ourselves, but really, we learnt a great deal in the process.","157":"Their red velvet cupcakes are AMAZING! Their buttercream frosting is fantastic and I also like their brownies when they have them. The location couldn't be better. I'd say you couldn't find a more romantic date-spot. I won't give them 5 stars though, since I have had some dry cupcakes in the past and they seem to always run out of the good stuff (mostly the red velvet) on weekends which is the only time I can make it over there.","158":"I so disagree with a couple of the reviews I read. Dr Miller is one of the best doctors I've ever seen and I've seen and worked with many as a medical professional. She is very detailed and shows concern regarding all aspects of my health. I have referred several people to her.   Highly recommended!!!","159":"My experience went from bad to worse.  This place is filthy and the employees are extremely rude. I pawned an item and when I went back to pick it up the place we closed.  I went back first thing in the morning to pick up the item. I was told that the finance charge was double for being a day late.","160":"I love this place. Lots of great, healthy options. Excellent variety, friendly staff, no exorbitant prices. Doesn't beat being held by someone who cares about you, but what does? Enough melancholy from me...go forth and eat healthy","161":"I've received great service and highly recommend Stone Law. I've been a client for many years and can attest they do great work!","162":"They specialize in Southern California-style food like burritos, salsas and fish tacos. The decor and ambiance is great. The tables and bar stools, exposed-brick wall, modern light fixtures etc. make for a classy and comfortable dining experience. I saw a few craft beers and a respectable bourbon list. However, we did an early Saturday morning breakfast, which was fantastic. The banana pancakes were unreal.","164":"Absolute waste of money. My husband and I felt no different after using the oxygen bar, massages and drinking the $5 peppermint drink. The employee was very sweet, but don't waste your money. This place would get 1 star if the customer service sucked. And they tell you it's $22 for the oxygen, but they also charge $5 for the thing that goes in your nose.","165":"The 5 for 6 'til 7 is so awesome and such a great deal! I wasn't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans. I would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly! We got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full.  I have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal :)","166":"It was my first time here and I was definitely\nImpressed. The groomers work and etiquette was lovely. I usually need the works when it comes to my little schweenie mix. ;) I'm glad I went to her and will most definitely be back!","167":"The only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because of their food and drinks. Their service however, is probably the WORST I've ever had. I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat. \n\nWhen we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was \"going to be complicated or not.\" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too. \n\nI had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service. Definitely do NOT recommend going there!!! Don't know exactly which was our original waitress but our checks said Joanne G. \n\nWill also be posting my experience on your Facebook in hopes that you get better trained and caring staff.","168":"I've been here a couple of times by recommendation from a Korean friend. The Jjamppong and Jjajangmyun are very delicious. It's even better when they're cheaper on the special menu days (rotates every other day). The portions are very generous. I usually share 1 dish with my friend. It's $5.00 (Jjajangmyun - Tues,Thurs, Sat, Sun) and $6.99 (jjamppong - mon, wed, fri).\n\nHowever, I was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (I think it's Kochu Japchae)... it was super pricey!!! That dish alone was $20.99 on the special... very little meat, mostly peppers and some other veggies. I'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns... 'cause those looked really intricately made.  I think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu. I'll just stick to the affordable menu items.\n\nIn general, I really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun), and their service is friendly, but I don't think I can come here without my Korean friend. It seems like the servers don't speak English, and there is no translated menu...","169":"Horrible experience I went in to get a full set french tips the guy who did them was very rude never said a word only yanked at my hand he cut my real nails after I told him not to. I complained about bubbles and dust inside the acrylic they acted like they couldn't see it. Two days later my nails are lifting and more bubbles appeared. I will never go here again and hope others don't waste their time or money at this place.","170":"Driving more than an half-hour to get to a gun range was getting old. I was so happy to see this range open up in Cornelius. They have all the amenities that you would expect a range to have for modern shooters. I come here for recreational purposes and have found the range more than suitable. They have fully electronic systems and the lanes are wide and not tight like many other ranges. They also offer memberships that are competitive to some of the other ranges around the area. Daily lane rates are a bit pricy, but considering their location they can charge that much. \n\nHowever, stray away from the touristic prices for weapons and ammo. There are many other stores that just sell and you'll want to visit those. The prices they quoted me were $200 more than several other stores and I just couldn't bite that bullet. \n\nCome here for the range and range only.","171":"Also don't believe when they say they will give you a credit for unsatisfactory meal because for some reason they have a tendency to forget they said it.  They no longer have to worry about my business.","172":"We stopped by for a little shopping. The mall is nicer than most and has plenty of stores. It was a nice way to spend a few hours before heading on to another adventure.","173":"I hope that every person who follows me, everyone I know and anyone contemplating this establishment reads this first and NEVER bothers to give this place with the crappiest staff of all time a second thought. Earlier today my friend and I dropped in to grab some lunch.. the staff either all lost their dogs this morning, or just have the absolute worst attitudes you've ever seen in human beings. Not only was the nasty woman who served me avoiding any type of pleasantry but she was yelling across two other workers and a line of patrons asking what I wanted from the other end of the shop. When I asked the server for lettuce, onion and roasted red peppers on my sandwich she quite literally moaned very loud and followed it with yelling \"ughhhhh god help me!\" Before adding my toppings to my turkey sandwich. When one of the other servers asked us if our food was for \"here or to go\" the original server says aloudly \"to-go hopefully!!!\" Wtf... I'd love to know who this terrible human being thinks she is! I found my jaw on the floor more than once, wondered why she thought I was such a headache, and my friend and I decided right there that we would NEVER return nor would we let this review go untold to everyone we know!! I feel the owners somehow have to be to blame! How the hell do you allow someone so miserable represent your livelihood? You don't expect livelihood for very much longer, that's how. \nPs... maybe this server will look a little less \"I just woke up\" at her next job.","174":"Cafe Maya, the newest coffee shop in this location. Not too much has changed, although the inside seems a bit more spacious and cozy. They offer all of your typical coffee drinks and prices are reasonable. They have a couch and a large chair as well as around 10 wooden tables with chairs. They offer a food menu for breakfast and lunch, but not dinner. They also have a rewards punch card for loyal customers. This place is usually pretty quiet and chill and not too busy, so a good place to go for some casual studying. There is no parking lot, so you have to hope to find a street parking spot available nearby which is the main limitation if you are driving. Overall a nice little coffee shop.","175":"Unbelievable experience start to finish.\n\nWe had a reservation for 9pm Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders. There is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice. Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.\n\nOur party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.\n\nThe menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.\n\nFor dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.\n\nEvery wine pairing we tried was amazing.\n\nUnfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations. \n\nExpect to be here for a while. Our reservation was at 9 and we only finished eating at 11:37- and we're not slow eaters. I think the wait had to do with our party being big and the rest of the place being packed","176":"Wild every night! My favorite place hands-down in AZ! The night life here is contagious and Iv never been disappointed with there Sunday fun day! Every Sunday they have a corn hole competition and crazy drink specials like penny refills!! You also have to try there duck and pork tacos or there Hefe Hamburger! My favorite margarita on the menu is the la chica flaca. If you want a fun place to get lunch and a few drinks or looking to go crazy night this is the spot.","178":"Service was amazing, Christina was extremely tentative and took care of our whole group. Asked about splitting checks from the beginning which for a large group is very convenient!","179":"Right off the bat, I need to tell you that I love thrift store shopping. Adore it. occasionally have sultry dreams about it. Okay, we'll stop there. \n\nSavers is the heaven and hell of Las Vegas thrift stores. You have to be willing to get dirty, to get on your knees and repent. You have to suffer through repeated disapointments in order to achieve the nirvana of a true thrift store find. \nFirst trip out - chewed up Barbie dolls and incomplete board games. Second trip - A set of Christmas lights marked for $2 more than at the Walmart they same from. But then, on the third trip back, there it is - the chimera. The unicorn. The 36\" 1970's black velvet painting of two tigers in flagrante delicto. The Elvis cookie jar. The wine cooler made out of an abandoned suit of armor. The red leather Michael Jackson Thriller jacket. A bronze toreador sculpture. And it's only $12.99. \nAh- Thrift-gasm. Thank you Savers. I'll see you next week.","180":"The gang at Sun Valley Stereo is definitely top notch. Ryan gets right to the point and saw what I was interested in, and we worked together to verify that all the parts were in to upgrade my 2004 RX-8 with a Pioneer 4000NEX touchscreen and back-up camera before I drove 90 minutes for the work. When I first left there was some adjustments needed. They took me back in without hesitation and made everything right. The installer was committed to treating my car like it was his own. He took the extra steps to make it all right, and even fixed the hatch door to my 12-volt socket. Now that's going the extra mile! 6-stars!","181":"My family and I have been visiting this location since it opened. Can't really remember the year now. \n\nAlthough several of the reviews have to do with bad customer service, I have found that it's definitely a staff turnaround issue. We go often during the summers, and well, all year round actually. LoL. It's never too cold to get ice cream in AZ, am I RIGHT?????\n\nAnywho, the ice cream is always yummy and the experience of the kids being able to run back and forth AND BACK AND FORTH trying new flavors or deciding which one to pick It's always fun!  \n\nSadly, the smiling faces might not always be there, but thankfully, we always have a smile on OUR FACE that transfers to them weather the staff likes it or not. LoL","182":"I have been there for 5 different tattoos now and could not be happier with the work done. My artist has been Eric R. and he has always done an incredible job. His attention to detail is second to none. I have recommended to friends who have been incredibly pleased with the work done. All the artists there are friendly and make the experience that much better. 5 stars and then some. Highly recommend to anyone!","184":"Please try this place. The food is incredible and you can tell the people that run it are super-appreciative of everyone that comes through the door. They are very proud of their food and they make sure to tell you it's all made in house - i.e. no cans of anything. The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.\n\nThe enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were saut\u00c3\u00a9ed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.\n\nWarning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy. Those were the spiciest enchiladas I've ever had, but I appreciate the spice. My gf, however, was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas. \n\nBy the way, the carnitas were excellent, as well.\n\nThis place gets five stars and I can't wait to go back. Please, please try this place. It was empty when I walked in and that's a shame. They should have a lot more business if it was all based on the quality of their food and service. It's also very affordable. Chicken enchiladas were $9 and the carnitas were somewhere around there (maybe $12).","185":"Great environment, I loved their meat jun. Very flavorful. Also they give side dishes which is definitely a bonus","186":"What a mess. Been in line over an hour and there are still about 10 people in front of me. Should've stuck with the company I usually use....next counter or two over. Came here based on SW Airlines suggestion and email. Ugh","187":"I don't normally say things are the best but these are the best fajitas I've ever had. Chips are perfect ,salsa is perfect, bean dip is perfect, and the best fried ice cream I've ever had. Plus the service is great.","188":"Great venue. Every seat in the house is awesome. Been here twice, once for Britney and another time for Jlo. Both were fantastic performances; sexy, sultry, and high energy! Love, love them and this venue!","189":"I did not visit the Kent office, but the office of Dr. Brown in Fairlawn. She was lacking in compassion, clarity, kindness, and professional ethics. She judged me based on my  pharmacutical history, and did not even glance at the stack of medical records I brought with me. I have been treated by some of the best in the country at John Hopkins and Walter Reed, and to be treated so unprofessionally in this office was an insult to the profession. Do NOT waste your time with Dr. Brown!","190":"Definitely a spot to check out when looking for a quality sandwich at a reasonable price.\n\nThe shop staff are very friendly and more than willing to accommodate any request. \n\nDo yourself a favor and get one of the steak sandwiches off of the menu. They are amazing. The ultra is my favorite.\n\nAlso the Cancun fries are awesome. 1 order is for sue big enough to serve 2 people maybe even 3! \n\nThis is one of the Peppis that takes credit cards as well. Not all do FYI","191":"I had THE BEST VEGAN Gardein chicken plate with broccolini. I was blown away!!! The decor is cute! Nicely dimly lit, It was romantic and very chic. I recommend coming if you're a vegan looking for a good dinner!","193":"Thank you so much Tanner!  Fantastic job.  Super nice clean shop.  Respectful, professional.  Just great.  \n\nthanks again.","195":"I love coming to pastel ! My favorite items are the black sesame crepe and the green tea crepe. Their waffles are good too, but I personally like crepes more. The ice cream and whipped cream is not too sweet which I like. I recently tried their matcha batter crepe, it wasn't bad, but I prefer sticking to plain crepes with green tea or black sesame ice cream.\n\nI think pastel is a great dessert spot after having dinner around the area. The outdoor seating also makes it a perfect date spot in the summer.","196":"Seeing \"Chicago\" in the name of a taco shop gave me a little pause, but the food and employees are both 5 stars. \n\nThe Asada fries were awesome! The meat was well seasoned and had that perfect grilled crunch that I love. You can choose nacho cheese or cheddar,  I chose the cheddar, and they put a good portion on.  It's topped with Pico,  sour cream   and a huge scoop of fresh guac. Lovely dish!\n\nI also had a pastor taco, which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere.  The pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled. \n\nOverall a great experience: Food was great and the staff was very friendly.  The owner came to the table to  ask how the food was and we talked for a few minutes. He was genuinely interested in feedback and his passion for cooking and providing a great experience for his customers was very evident.\n\nI recommend everyone stop in and give this place a try.  It is now on my list of regular lunch spots when I am on the N. Side.","197":"What a cute place! I was visiting relatives in the area and we went here to grab coffee and breakfast. The egg sandwich I got on a bagel was HUGE and tasty, but it was pretty greasy. The coffee is really good and the service is fast and friendly. I recommend it!","198":"Went to Vegas again Memorial Day Weekend but this time with my girlfriends so wanted them to try this place since LOVED it so much when I came with hubby.\n\nThis time tried the Angry Dog and just as amazingly deelish!!!\n\nFriends got Chili (homemade by Buldogis) Dog, Bulgogi Bowl, Fries, and again the Euro Fries with kimchee added and they LOVED it too!   My 2 friends who had the Chili Dog said the chili was very good! One of them is not even a hotdog fan and loved it :)\n\nIF you are EVER in Vegas THIS is a MUST!!!","199":"Good environment, I ordered the famous meatloaf and it is large but a little bit salty. The waitress is not that friendly but overall I had a great experience.","200":"Love this place!! Delicious! I just wish it was closer to my house. Other than that, I have no complaints. The price point is reasonable and the menu selection is great. Couldn't ask for anything else!","201":"Wonderful cookies, but don't order delivery. Took almost 2 hours to deliver less than a mile.... and no refund.","202":"Food taste Ok. I like the pasta selection. However, there is No seafood choices at all. If you are looking for seafood, skip this place.","203":"Perfect Grilled Cheese was amazing and worth a repeat  visit.  Chicken club lacked unique flavor and was average.  The BLT was great with the bread making the sandwiches.  Now for the sides: tomato soup was delicious and a perfect complement to the grilled cheese.  Shoe string fries were great, nothing not to like about them and the green pea salad in peanut sauce was delicious.  We will definitely return for another try!","204":"Good fresh and home cooked food. Loved breakfast especially biscuits and gravy Small quaint place that does get busy. Decent pricing.","205":"I went here today to upgrade to an iPhone X. They were awesome to work with. They mirrored everything from my current phone to the new one. That saved me so much time and aggravation if I had to do it. They were very knowledgeable and friendly! Highly recommend!","207":"As soon as I parked my car, this rude elderly lady comes out saying these parking spaces are reserved...I UNDERSTAND AND CAN READ THAT ON YOUR SIGN lady.  Just because my other family members are dinning at Hong Kong Garden for Dim Sum does not automatically mean that EVERYONE is looking to eat there.  I was and had a craving for deli sandwiches in which I did ended up walking in to purchase 2 as planned (receipt still in hand).  Don't go around assuming and start off with horrible service.  I ended up keeping my car parked there the WHOLE afternoon taking a space just because that lady was rude.  \n***Also would be nice to offer water for your customer that is waiting for his to-go order***","208":"We lived in Mexico for several years so are always looking for authentic restaurants. La taquizza does a good job.  Their menu is diverse and includes many of our favourite dishes you don't typically find in Canada.  The food is much better in house than as take out.  We have ordered many dishes off the menu and love anything carnitas and the fact that they have decent corn tortillas. The huraches are great too. I am a bit biased about the tacos al pastor since I lived in Puebla, but they are still ok. Can't miss the mandatory churros though. They are amazing!","210":"I am so blown away by this sophisticated & beautiful hotel. One of the best in Las Vegas. The decor is breathe taking, and this place always smell like a magical garden. With so many top notch restaurants, spa services, shows, and clubs to choose from. It's vegas luxury! The last time I stayed here, July 2011, it was such a BIG disappointment. There was a total of 8 of us. One of the bed broke and fell flat to the floor (no, there were no foul play)! 6 out 8 of us left with some kind of bug bite that looks like a terrible case of eczema\/rash! The mechanic curtain didn't work. The main T.V. didn't work. Actually, disappointed is an understatement, WE WERE DISGUSTED! How can this 5star resort & hotel failed us so miserably!!!!!? \n\n(please view pictures of rash)","211":"The brussel sprout nachos are really as good as the other reviewers have mentioned! I've had them more then a few times and everyone always loves them, be careful because they can easily fill you up! Individual tacos and the burritos are great too. I've also had a few of their salads and love them, big a portion sizes. Great classic margarita as well, love this place for groups esp on Sunday when is all day happy hour!","212":"Really underwhelming flash brewed plastic spigot stored coffee, coffee \"menu\" consists of different syrup and coffee concoctions rather than regional or single origin blends or even fresh roasted beans. The red eye was okay, certainly nothing special, but drinkable. Once witnessed management screaming at kids over phone, weird experience as a patron of a business.","213":"Gluten free options promised, so we tried a turkey sandwich with avocado.   Large portion--very delicious.  5 choices of iced tea blends(free refills) and coffee choices made for a perfect girls' afternoon. Lots of seating outside on the covered patio.  Their parking fills quickly, but plenty of options on street or at the Municipal Bldg.","214":"We had a great lunch experience today at Rubios. It didn't start out that way but was quickly turned while we were checking out since we were using promotions.\n\nWe used the Yelp check in offer for a free entree with the purchase of a drink which is an awesome way to try something new. It was also ocean day insulated bag day which is really nice and will be used when grocery shopping this summer or transporting hot food to keep it warm. \n\nWe had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco. The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup. \n\nI really recommend going to Rubios for a lighter refreshing meal, try the fish tacos and sign up for their club for emails on special offers.","215":"So I've been coming here for years and have never had any issues until today. I ordered what I've always ordered. A bean burrito, a taco and a drink. It cost over $9 dollars!! The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy\/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!! They don't false advertise there either! Furious!  Their food and prices have gone downhill fast! They lost mine and my family's business for good!!","216":"Amazingly professional & compassionate staff. We recently lost an animal member of the family, and I was pleasantly surprised today with a follow up hand written sympathy card personalized and singed by the whole group. Thank you!","217":"Came to this place based on yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Got the chicken wings to start, kao soi with chicken and an dish from the chefs special - Steamed fish coconut curry. Chicken wings were good, especially when hot, the sauce gelatinized as it cooled. Kao soi was the best I've ever had, an excellent portion ans the chicken was very tender. The the fish coconut curry was good too, wasn't much of a curry but was still very flavourful. Service was fast and people were so friendly and kind. Will definitely go back to try other menu items.","218":"Great food in a homely Mexican setting. The tomato soup was amazingly delicious and their chicken dishes are great. Close to the intersection of College & Yonge, this is one of the few non-fast food Mexican restaurants in the Village area.  If you're searching for a non-commercial dining experience with homemade dishes, this is the place to come.","219":"Ikea....an experience!\n\nI adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.\n\nWhen you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! \n\nIkea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars\/trucks\/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!\n\nDo yourself a favor, plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom, have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit, then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires! \n\nIkea....an experience!","220":"Don't let the location or the look of the building fool you. When I tell you this is THE BEST PLACE FOR AUTHENTIC MEXICAN EATS! I cannot stop eating their taco gringos Omg so yummy and everything is cooked to order right in front of you. This is the only place that can compare to the Hispanic food in California! You have to try it! DEFINITELY DESERVES MORE THAN 5 stars!!!!","222":"Go. Seriously. You will not be disappointed one bit!\n\nWe were craving breakfast food and decided to check this place out. We shared a skillet and a few breakfast sides, each of which were cooked to perfection and super tasty. The atmosphere here is cute, clean, and just what you want for enjoying your breakfast. \n\nWhat really made our day being here was our awesome server, Tina. She was so cool, upbeat, easy to talk with, and was the most accommodating server you could ever hope to have. We plan on returning for more good eats and to see Tina again. :)","223":"The one and only cashier working was so slow and  chatted with every customer while there is a long line. I never seen anything like it! Shooting the breeze while there is a long line of people who have other things to do is unacceptable. With all the other negative reviews I hope they get there act together because Sephora has much better service and hate to see another store close.","225":"So based on food alone they would have 3 stars but thats just not the case..arrived just after 5pm..they had a private party going on but they looked to be well taken care of and winding down...after placing our order we got our drinks and found a table...went back to wait for our food and was told they will bring it out to us...after 15 minutes and watching someone who ordered after us receive their food i went back up to the desk. ..and watched as our food sat on the counter and for another 5 minutes before they finally brought it out...and they didn't have our full order..it took the food runner 3 separate trips..heres a run down of our order\nPulled chicken..not actually pulled but diced and dry\nTurkey..very good moist and tender \nPulled pork..very good..lot of flavor\nMac and cheese..not the best but not the worst\nGreenbeens..good..the only hot side we got\nBanana bread pudding..full of butter but not horrible\nOverall food was 3 stars service was 1","227":"From out of state and rolled up.  Richard greeted us and we had great customer service.  Thanks so much.","228":"Hank's definitely stays on my list of places that wow me. Great atmosphere from the bar area with live music, to the great booth in the dining room with all the hustle and bustle of the staff creating that fine dining experience.  We felt very comfortable and well taken care of. Even had the manager share a bottle of wine with us! A memorable evening.","229":"My husband and I used to order from here more than I'd like to admit (almost weekly). The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. \n\nLast time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.\n\nI paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. \n\nWhen we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin. \n\nI walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"I'll be right with you.\" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say \"Wow, you are really something else.\" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. \n\nI honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction\/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.\n\nI realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.","230":"Just found out about this secret treasure!  Love this studio and the staff!!!! I haven't practiced yoga in a studio for a while, but this place is very welcoming to Yogi's of all levels! I love power flow with Shannon- she's got a great energy and inspires me to challenge myself! Love love love this studio! If you are going for the first time, park off Glenway by the bank- its easier to find! :)","231":"Amazing service, great vibe, and fair prices.  Their Asian\/Hawaiian fusion was perfect.  We'll be back!","232":"Real friends show up with BOSA donuts when things are awry. Their boba tea is yummy but needs more ball choices.","233":"Dined here a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night -- actually sat at the bar with my three fellow diners and had an absolutely amazing evening -- food, wine, service all made for a perfect experience.\n\nTried almost all the appetizers and 'small plates' and they were exceptional.\nStandouts were: almond spread, harcha bread, quinoa salad, beef kefta\n\nShared a fish tagine for 4 and it was also excellent!\n\nHighly recommend this place - I know we'll be back!","234":"I love this place. I come here whenever I'm in town for business. The taco Tuesday deals are unbelievably amazing. The tacos are only two dollars each, but they could be charging much more for the quality that they are. They also have a good IPA on tap that is only five dollars a pint. All of the staff is incredibly nice and they have great music here too. I also love the fact that there's tons of monitors everywhere so you can see games from every angle of the venue. They also have a great outdoor seating area that is right on the sidewalk and located on a busy downtown corner which suits all the people watchers well.","235":"Great food and greatCustomer service.They messed up my order and when they realized they apologized and returned our money.","236":"Love this place. Great atmosphere - sports bar but with just the right amount of class. Great house beers, friendly serving staff, amazing drunk food. A fun place to go with friends ir family + an adventuruous take on the traditional bar menu","237":"Around $45 for a dinner on a Friday night.\nSnow and Kind crab, caviar, steak tartare, all types of meat and cuts, sushi, soups, Asian cuisine, pastas and pizzas. Literally all you can think about.\nAlmost everything we tried was really good. \nTheir dessert section and flavors are one of the best !\n\nRecommended for sure","238":"We found out about this gem from The Man's co-worker who used to live in the same apt. complex we live in now. It's about a mile away from our apt. and we finally gave it a try a while back. \n\nIt is delicious! The chips are mini tortillas that you break off and have with salsa. Very yum. The food is delicious! I don't remember what I had the last time we went here, but I managed to finish more than half of it and had some to take home (tastes better later, IMO). The portions are generous and filling. \n\nThe wait staff is always nice and attentive. I remember the first time we visited, it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. \n\nIf we're in the mood for mexican food and don't want a fast food experience, we definitely choose this place.","239":"Went in on a Friday since I was strolling around the Venetian and came across this place! The wait wasn't too bad around 1pm (probably 25 minutes max). This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating. However, the portions are on the smaller side so it's perfect to have lunch there if you don't want lug any leftovers around!","242":"I'm a fan of BMW.  My X3 lasted me 10 years and although there were a few hiccups, I can still say that car was pretty darn reliable and I got my money's worth. But sometimes, you just have to let go and find a replacement.\n\nI did my research and considered getting a Mini, Fiat or a Lexus. My loyalty is with BMW. I locked in on a particular car and off to the dealer I went. We were walking around the lot looking at other models and colors when a car salesman saw us and helped me get my car. My sister kept throwing her ideas and opinions as to what car I should get. I told David (sales advisor) what features I need and we ended up with the first car I was looking at.\n\nThen, the dreaded test driving the car. I'm not a big fan of driving a car that isn't mine...or driving, period! I think convincing me to test drive took the most time and David told me to just drive around the lot but that was a trick! There was a part of the lot that's blocked off by a semi and the only way around it is to get on the road. My sister was a backseat driver as if I needed to be more anxious but David kept me calm. He's so funny. We made it back to the dealership in one piece.\n\nI signed my papers and wrote my check but it was gym time so, we told David we'd come back for the car after the gym since they still had to detail it anyway. It was the most entertaining car-buying experience ever. We were all laughing and chatting about cars, the gym, nutrition, Hello Kitty, Yoda, etc. David explained and showed me what my car can do and at the end he said, \"I wish all my clients are as fun as you.\"\n\nI get follow-up phone calls and e-mails and if I have any questions about my car, David responds quickly.  If you ever need\/want a car, contact David Politzer - he is fantastic and he has a nice profile picture on his business card too.","243":"This place rules! Best tacos in town and not too pricy! Always clean and has an awesome patio.   Staff is friendly, very welcoming.  Will def be back!","244":"Without a doubt,  my favorite Indian restaurant to date. There is a lot of variety, but my favorite dish is the chicken korma. The butter chicken is also fantastic. It is deliciously sweet and kid-friendly because it is not too spicy. For those of you who like to feel the burn, they have plenty of options to choose from, as well. I recommend the Thali for people who are just starting to explore their Asian culinary senses. Also, if you are a naan connoisseur, you need add Palais d'Ajit to your list.\n\nDon't expect any fancy surroundings. It looks like a hole in the wall but you'll be convinced to enter the door when you get a whiff of the food (which can be detected from a block away). The staff are very friendly although sometimes the service is slow. If you don't like to wait, call ahead and take it home!","245":"Simply the best place to call home.  All the amenities, cool vibe, great pool scene, 24 hour concierge service, same day laundry, dedicated parking, secure entry.  HOA reasonable.  What's not to like in condo living?","246":"OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...\n\nThere are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value\/frequent\/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. \n\nFOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? \n\nI'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  \n\nI ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. \n\nA few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. \n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. \n\nI won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.\n\nService: 4 stars\n\nKitch: 4 stars\n\nFood: 1 star","247":"Azzip Pizza is literally SO good. I have been there so many times and each time I get a \"Big Zip\" for $8.22. The place is amazing and the pizza cooks in about 2 minutes. It is the build your own concept and I have never had a bad experience there. Also, I go there about 4 times a week.. Don't worry I hit the gym, sometimes..","248":"Love this place.  We go all the time.  Wings are the best cocktails are good and well priced.  Don't confuse with the terrible place with a similar name on Thurnderbird and 43 avenue.","249":"When I compare Over Easy with other places, maybe I don't find it my ultimate Sunday morning family breakfast place, but I'd definitely drop by with my pals for some home-style fries once in a while...\n\nEverything is what you'd expect from a $10-$15 breakfast, and that's why I gave it 4-stars.\n\nThe waitresses are really nice and friendly, which is the kick start of a good morning.\n\nGo with \"The Big Breakfast\" for ~$12 if you're hungry, and I'm telling you, you'd be pretty full by the end of it you wouldn't want lunch!","250":"Just took the 6:30am class - My muscles have been so sore from crossfit and I needed a good stretching. I really need more yoga in my life! The class was fantastic! A nice 60 minute class, heated and the music was lovely. The yoga instructor's voice was soothing - which I think is soo important. \n\nWhat a great class.. I feel refreshed! A great studio as well - nice and roomie. Looking forward to my next class!","251":"Food is prepared fresh and flavored are great. Eaten three lunches and all were great. Service is a combined effort, so they on top of any needs.","252":"I ate at New India Bazaar for dinner. I took it to go. I ordered samosa, pani puri chaat, and gobi. The samosas were very good and very big! The main dish, gobi was really great. As a vegetarian it seemed like I was eating chicken, but it was cauliflower dumplings. The gobi had a comfort food appeal. The pani puri chaat was weird. I've never had it before, so I don't have a comparison. The description sounded yummy, but it just wasn't. The total cost was about $14. I would recommend this restaurant. I noticed that they have a pastry case with desserts. I plan to come back to shop. They  have the best prices that I've seen on neem toothpastes.","253":"Awesome food and service! Really wish we had one in Oahu! Our servers were on it! Thank you for working it out and fitting in our party of 9!","254":"I went here yesterday and I got the best service I ever got at a restaurant. The waiter helped me on the grill constantly checked on me to see if everything was ok, the food was great and so was the service and everything was A++++ pricing was great as well it came out to around $18.\n\nI am going back to Vegas for my Birthday next month I will try there sushis.","255":"The Four Stars = to  how expensive this place is.  I only saw two dollar signs for this place, but it should be four dollar signs.\n\nI don't remember what I ordered but it all came to $75.00\n( 2 ) bacon egg sandwiches \n( 2 ) other breakfast sandwiches\n( 2 ) breakfast desserts\n( 2 ) juices or water\nI'm pretty sure this was all I ordered.\n\nIt tasted good because at 2:30am we were all hungry.  I ordered to go since the place was packed from all the clubbers and hotel guests that was here.  I remember that I didn't have to wait very long after placing my order.  I remember that we all scarfed it down in matter of a minute.  I vaguely remember crawling into bed soon after.","256":"hi, went to anthonys last thurs. night with a party of seven. We were celebrating an anniversary , we all dressed up to the nines ! ! wanted to have a fun nite out ! \nthe food is good, very high end .  2 of us ordered the prime rib, 2 others ordered filet, 3 others steak, plus apps of sashimi, tator tots, mashed potatoes, \nspinach, lobster bisques for all, they do charge extra for everything... so watch out,\nwe sat outside it is a nice view..... now the bad part... our waiter, Fabio. I don't like to be disrespectful to our food servers here in Vegas cuz they do work hard, but Fabio is\nvery rude, rushed us during our ordering, did not want to explain the specials after my uncle asked a question, he said he did not know, did not bring our drinks until after our dinner was served by someone else, he was very rude when we asked for another martini and never brought it. he also did not bring water until we asked four times cuz we passed on the bubbles water, he also tried to take out plates before we were done ! the place was empty, three times he wanted to take my plate with food on it ...jeeeez..... Anthonys please he needs more training on how to treat customers :(","257":"A tale of two locations (AKA: AVOID 7700 S Autoplex, GO TO 616 W Baseline)\n\nFirst the good: 616 W Baseline\n\nI have been a loyal repeat customer of Cobblestone Auto Spa ever since I encountered Jared, one of the managers at the 616 W Baseline. \n\nThe first time I went there I had my car detailed for $150 after discounts. The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.\n\nI am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.\n\nCOBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!\n\nNow the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex\n\nI first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.\n\nI then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.\n\nI then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.\n\nWhen I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.\n\nFinally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.\n\nI went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.\n\nThe next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. \n\nI knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.\n\nI suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.\n\nAs a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.\n\nI went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. \n\nThey reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.\n\nJared to the rescue:\n\nI took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.\n\nLesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!\n\nCOBBLESTONE, BAD MANAGERS MAKE FOR A BAD STAFF. GREAT MANAGERS MAKE FOR A GREAT STAFF.","258":"I have visited this place several times. They have great happy hour prices and their regular menu prices are very reasonable too. Their entrees are big enough to share, my favorite is their fish tacos. They tend to get pretty busy on Friday nights, so there is sometimes a bit of a wait. Overall, thumbs up!","259":"The location was excellent and the restaurant was beautiful. The food was awful and our server was very rude and impolite.\nWe were a group of 6 people and whatever we ordered was worse than another one!\nEven my little daughter who loves french fries couldn't eat them because they weren't fresh and she thought that they were artificial!!!","260":"My favorite burger joint! Simple, yet delicious! Service is always great with cheerful greetings and happy smiles.","262":"Juan's is ALWAYS busy because it's ALWAYS good. It's great food, but the excellent, friendly service is what keeps people coming back. I've been here dozens of times...date nights, with family, with kids, girls nights. Always wonderful. Try the shrimp ceviche!","263":"Came here while in town for a country concert.  What better way to start our day.  Everything was great.  The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!","264":"Fabulous. A friend took me here last night. Wonderful food, we had panang curry, duck fried rice and Chilean sea bass.  What a wonderful combination of flavors.","265":"I was very skeptical about this spot. \nFirst it's almost impossible to find good authentic legit spots on the Las Vegas strip for exotic cuisines- hispanic, Asian middle eastern, etc. If you want one, go off the strip. \n\nsecond A place that proudly serves \"Middle eastern\" and also \"Greek\" food usually misses those authentic flavors. For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli\/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion. \n\nAnd yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good! \nThe lamb shawarma was also good.\nAnd branzino fish with labaneh was on point. \n\nEven though our hostess did a terrible job, our server was lovely. \n\nSo bottom line. Worth visiting. A solid 4 stars spot. \nTrust me. I know food.","266":"Worse than before.\nOverpriced, and HORRIBLE service.\n\nWhen a group says \"We're really thirsty. Could you please bring water while we look at the menu?\" You'd better frickin' BRING IT! \n\nOur waiter was pushy, rude, and S...L...O...W...\nWhen we said that we weren't interested in hearing the specials, he read them anyway. \n\nHe constantly tried to upsell us. Every order placed was followed by a pause, and \"Well, you know what would be really good...?\" followed by a big description of a more expensive item or an add-on.\n\nThe desperately needed water took almost twenty minutes to get to our table.\n\nThe table next to us, who was seated at least five minutes after us, received their water, drinks, and first course before we even got our water. \n\nDo I sound like I'm obsessing about water? In the desert, dehydration is no joke, and it's indicative of the quality (bad - very very bad) of service that we received.\n\nThe sushi was good, but not great.\nThe main courses were simple but extremely expensive.\nAll sides were extra.\nWe spent about $250 for three people on very basic food and a glass of wine each.\n\nNever again.\nNever never never.","267":"Hands down, this is the best pizza place in Mentor! Their pizza is so delicious that the smell alone is enough to make you drool! The cheesy bread is soft and cheesy and just goodness. The pizza is good for leftovers and the next day. The service and staff is very friendly. 5 stars for sure!","268":"I went with the ziti. Just as I remembered, the sauce was awful. The pasta was in a pool of water and the sauce had zero flavor. I just feel like a sauce can make or break the meal, and it was tasteless-- no garlic, onion, wine, basil.. Nothing. The portion was also quite small for the price. It was clearly boxed pasta and not homemade, so why so stingy? I'm surprised there are such high reviews on here actually as my experience and my family's experience wasn't great. I guess it's a decent place for families, but I would definitely go to a different Italian restaurant if you're looking for good food.","269":"We usually go to Lindo Michoac\u00c3\u00a1n when we want Mexican at a sit down restaurant, but I felt like we were just there and talked my husband into trying Juan's.\nOk, we're hooked! Service was great.\nWe got the Fajitas for 2 with Steak and Chicken, add cheese...so good, lots of flavor. Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers, the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite.\nMy only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left, I smelled like I had worked the grill, my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy. I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down. I'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here.\nPrices were on par with other Mexican restaurants and you get more than enough to eat.\nWe will definitely be back and we'll be packing the Febreeze!","270":"Do your research people, this place is completely unprofessional. I went in for a Juvederm procedure in my lips, and I was very disappointed by the way I looked right after the procedure and even several weeks after. My lips were extremely painful, swollen, bruised, and disproportioned. This place is not a good place to go to for lip augmentation, be aware. Choose a good MD.","271":"Service was prompt and good. I ordered the roti canai which was excellent and also filling. The chicken curry for the roti wasn't thick, I think that's a good combination as a dip. I also ordered the lamb curry (I forgot the exact name.. Rendang?) the flavor was good but I didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better. The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey. Other than that it's excellent and I like their beverages that they have a grass jelly drink and Malaysian iced tea :). Will definitely come back again next time.","272":"It's extremely annoying that the Venetian chooses to broadcast Fox News at their VIP lounges against their customers' will and employees' will.  I would consider this harassment since neither have a choice to change the channel. I've tried. I have complained to the employees who state they are not able to change the channel. Trust me, the Venetian customers and their employees do NOT want to be forced to watch Fox News. Please change to a neutral channel or CNN which provides more transparent news.","273":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner evening and all I can say is it was awesome. Be prepared the drinks are powerful here and we made the mistake of getting Tequila shots on the side..but the frozen Margarita house drinks did not need it. Needless to say we took our time drinking and eating so we could travel home safely. Fantastic time...we will definitely visit this restaurant again... by the way ... I had the chicken shrimp and spinach entree and John had the mahi-mahi tacos... so good!","274":"I remember going to this salon a few years ago and I loved how fast thier service was(under 45 min). I'm glad that that hasn't changed. I did a refill on my seaweed bio gel nails with an air brushed french manicure because I saw it here on yelp and I didn't even know that was an option. My nail tech was nice she understood what I wanted and was very fast( without sacrificing quality). Sadly my only complain is that this place is located in markham which is out of my way. It would be cool if they opened up another location in the north York or downtown area.","275":"I'm a regular at chipotle in California, this is my first visit to this chipotle on s.las Vegas strip.this is pretty new place I think, I took a veggie bowl in which the rice was undone and the fajitas were all burnt, the quantity offered was less than usual. I'm very unhappy with this place.","276":"What an incredible experience this was. There is nothing particular special about the neighborhood atmosphere, but don't let that deter you. We were seated on the outside patio which was lovely on a warm summer evening. The service was exceptional as the staff was incredibly kind and attentive, but it was the food that really made this experience. From the crispy shrimp appetizer and beef tartar, to the octopus special and veal flank steak, the food was simply amazing. Unfortunately, we're from the San Francisco area so may not be back any time soon, but if this were in our home town neighborhood, we would come back weekly!","277":"I have taken my family to this place before.  We were quite happy with the service and food.  Recently, I bought a groupon for this restaurant.  We were not happy at all with the service and food.  First, they ask if we were using groupon and they marked it in a separate sheet.  We had no service at all.  The restaurant was not full and we saw other tables had their food while they order after us.  We waited for almost 30 minutes only two dishes came.   We spoke to the manager and the Waiter for the rest of the orders.  They said to check on our orders.  My kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came.  Finally when the order dish came and it was very salty.  We would definitely not recommend this place if you plan to buy Groupon.  We felt we were second class.  We would prefer to go elsewhere where we get excellent service and much better vegetarian food and we don't mind paying the little extra,such as graceful vegetarian by market village.","279":"These guys really are great, easy to work with, and provide a valuable service.\n\nI worked with Sammy to coordinate a night out with 10 girls for a bachelorette party in Vegas.  We decided to go to Tryst.  Sammy was very patient in taking multiple phone calls and answering all my questions, even throwing in a couple of extra perks at my request.  The pre-pay service is great--the company takes the total cost of the evening and divides it per person, creating a link online where each girl can go and pay ahead of time.  We didn't have to deal with a large bill or everyone's credit cards at the end of the night.  It was SO easy.\n\nSomeone from the company was in constant contact with me leading up to our night out.  Sammy, knowing how large of a group we had and how important a good table was to us, called me the night of to let me know they'd had a different, better table open up, and that he was giving it to us at no extra charge.  \n\nCraig was our host for the evening.  He contacted me promptly to provide detailed instructions on where to meet him and when.  Craig was waiting to greet us and, as promised, walked us right into the club and to our table, which had our bottles, mixers and waitresses waiting.  Craig stopped back a couple of times before leaving to make sure we were settled and having a good time.\n\nI contacted Sammy a couple more times throughout the weekend for various things, and he was more than helpful even though we weren't using them for additional reservations or nights out.  \n\nPlanning ahead is the way to go when it comes to Vegas, and while I don't think you HAVE to use an outside VIP company to plan, I don't really see a disadvantage to doing so.  I would definitely call Red Carpet VIP again.","280":"The worst. Got there 45 minutes after the store was supposed to be open and they weren't ready.  Ordered a sandwich and the oven hadn't been turned on.  I asked how long and the employee said a few minutes. 8 minutes later oven still not preheated and I let her know I had to go.  She then pulls the sandwich out of the oven.  Cleary the sandwich would not have been prepared correctly.  I did not take sandwich and had to leave to get to an appointment. My  quick stop for a coffee and breakfast to go was over 15 minutes.  When I sent in a complaint to the head office the slow response was they couldn't give me a credit but would send over coupons for a couple of beverages.  That is ridiculous.  I wanted a refund on the sandwich I never took. I pass by this second cup 5 days a week. I'm going to keep on driving and stick with Starbucks. You should also steer clear. Best example of the worst service.","281":"I went to Dr. Goth for a couple procedures, including wisdom teeth and to have a suspicious oral growth removed. Only one word - fantastic! His staff is excellent, and his art in dentistry and patient care unsurpassed. Cut and dried - Dr. Goth was outstanding. He is the man to see in the Pittsburgh area.","282":"2-3 years ago I found LifeScape Medical Associates randomly and started going there since then. Paying an annual fee, I'm expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level; however, LifeScape disappointed me again and again over the years. I have to give credit to their office environment though, it's always quiet and clean, and the receptionists are always friendly.\n\nThere're a few reasons I don't like it there:\n1. I feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine\/samples\/tests, and some of them are not necessary at all. For example, the doctor suggested me with a special blood test, twice, saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost. I believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab. Later I got a bill for almost $2000 (I know LifeScape always charges high prices, luckily I have a good health insurance so i don't really care, but still, $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) I called my insurance company, my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion. I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did. I'm really disappointed. How can people trust them if they do business like that!!! What's worse, up to this day, they still haven't informed me anything about the bill, nor the blood test result itself.\n\n2. The waiting time in the clinic is too long. I ALWAYS have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time. I know the doctor is busy, but the patient's time is precious too. I don't like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor. And when I finally get to meet with the doctor, I can tell that she is not patient enough. She seems in a hurry, I know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient.\n\n3. They don't have xRay machines. If you are need to get some xRay or CT scan done, I suggest you going somewhere else, even some small clinics have xRay machines. \n\nI normally only write positive reviews online, but this time i want to let people know about what's really going on there. I would NOT go there any more and I do NOT recommend LifeScape to anybody.","283":"I love the West Side Market but I can't stand the crowds, the parking, and the general gentrified douchery that seems to accompany the entire process. For me, it's just not worth it. Enter the Food Peddler Farmer's Market. I don't know whose idea it was to plop down a produce-centric farmer's market style grocery store in the heart of Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood, but I'd like to shake their hand. It's just what the doctor ordered.\n\nImagine, if you will, a bright, airy open market full of colorful fruit and vegetables from farms around the region, rows of farm fresh eggs, coolers filled with Amish chicken and local ground beef...yeah, right. No, really, it's true. I'm not saying this place is perfect, but for an area of Cleveland more known for it's shady strip mall bars and giant cemeteries it's a breath of fresh air. It does what Cleveland and the rest of the nation needs, it encourages consumption of fresh, local foods. So what do they have to offer?\n\n-Fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables with everything from plump bing cherries to more exotic fare like chayote and California avocados. \n\n-A bakery with Cleveland favorites like kugel and kolaczki and a deli stocked to overflowing with meats and cheeses from all over Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\n-A bulk section with plenty of flour, rice, pie fillings, nuts, seeds, and other goodies.\n\n-Giant bags of peanuts, onions, apples, and carrots.\n\n-A wall of bulk candy packaged in little containers perfect for hiding in your cupboard behind the quinoa and flax seeds.\n\n-Reasonable prices. It's not as cheap as fast food, no. But if you're gonna spend your money somewhere why not make it your health.\n\nI could go on and on about all of the products they've managed to cram into this place and about how friendly the staff was but I want to leave something for you to find out on your first visit. I know, it's not the West Side Market and it doesn't have nearly the sheer volume of items of this venerable food mecca but it's worth paying them a visit anyway. What it does have is a neighborhood feel, more parking, and a more intimate experience. Support a local business, eat local foods and give something back.","284":"Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.\n\nWe walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  \n\nMy family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  \n\nIn the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.","285":"Great wings , and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food . I don't drink so I can't say anything about that but over all a good neighborhood place .","286":"Worst service ever.  Only one here and took 10 minutes to get one drink out.  3 people behind the counter including the manager.  They were all talking and doing other things","287":"Driving late at night we were lucky to find the last room available at this location. The front desk clerk Breanne was super nice and helpful. The hotel felt welcoming and clean walking in, and the room was no different! I'd definitely stay again. We did not explore the other amenities.","288":"Christian and joe!! 5 stars!\nThanks for the quick resolution!\nGot the tech scheduled as best they could as quick they could and we're professional the whole time.","290":"--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! \n\nThis is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. \n\nManagement provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!","291":"Im obsessed with this place! Best dishes to try include: \n\nPozole- which is really filling! Great for when is freezing outside.... \n\nTacos dorados- they are the best ones I have tried in the city! \n\nEnchiladas during the morning on weekends are the best as well, delicious! And if you really want to try real huevos rancheros try them here!!!!! There are some other places in the neighbourhood to claim to offer them and trust me none of the are authentic as they are here. Always a great experience, keep the good work! Prices are so good also considering the freshness and quality of food, one of the best places to eat without breaking your pocket.","292":"The challah French toast paired with turkey bacon was a pretty awesome breakfast and I thoroughly enjoyed it; however, I felt the staff was lacking in service. They were very nice, just not very prompt and would disappear for quite some time.  I don't know if it was because a few people called out and they were short-staffed or if one should plan to stay awhile.  The food is very good, though.","293":"Tr\u00c3\u00a8s grand caf\u00c3\u00a9, mais aussi calme et reposant, je m'y suis arr\u00c3\u00aat\u00c3\u00a9 alors que j'\u00c3\u00a9tais dans le coin.\n\nOn peu y mang\u00c3\u00a9 le midi, prendre une p\u00c3\u00a2tisserie ou un caf\u00c3\u00a9\/th\u00c3\u00a9. \n\nJ'ai prit un th\u00c3\u00a9 qui \u00c3\u00a9tait vraiment bon, et je me suis pos\u00c3\u00a9 devant une des grandes baies vitr\u00c3\u00a9es sur un coussin et j'ai relax\u00c3\u00a9 compl\u00c3\u00a8tement pendant 2 heures. \n\nMais c'est aussi une coop\u00c3\u00a9rative d'artiste, avec une estrade etc.\n\nIl y a aussi un magasin Bio \u00c3\u00a0 l'entr\u00c3\u00a9e o\u00c3\u00b9 vous retrouverez des savons, huile d'olive et plein d'autres produits.","294":"The food was great Our server Karu was the bomb he was cool, very nice and good looking guy.

I bought them last and saved them for breakfast today. The sauce and tortillas were SO good!","296":"I e-mailed head office months ago about a lousy experience at their Yonge & College Street location and never received a response. Was never a huge fan to begin with but that confirmed things for me. \n\nOh, and the Cobb salad doesn't have chicken in it anymore...what a rip off!","297":"Awful. Nearly inedible... even for airport food. \nDon't push the \"prompt service\" button on the table. The waitress said that they ignore it. \nKeep walking.","298":"Much better coffee than the big chains.  This is a great place for a quick lunch or breakfast and the drive through makes caffeine fill ups easy.","299":"I used to work for Skechers in Las Vegas YEARS AGO. Everything at this store is the same. Except this store is much smaller! Especially the clearance section. I tried on some shoes. And that was it really.  We were greeted, but no one checked up on me blah, oh well...","300":"This restaurant is a real local secret. Open since 1965, the original owner and chef was still cooking in the kitchen on a Monday night at 10:00 when most restaurants were closed. So happy I found it. Amazing food, wonderful authentic Italian atmosphere and friendly, and well-timed  service in English, French or Italian!","301":"Just a couple days ago, I adopted my little Sayuri from the Arizona Humane Society.  The entire process was seamless, and it was evident it was in the societies best interest to make sure these lovable pets find the right home.  \n\nI first went in to see a couple of puppies, and I really like 2 in particular.  Because I already have a dog at home, and my boyfriend wasn't able to join me, I put one of them on hold (they will hold your pet for the day) and went back a few hours later.  It is required that if you already have a dog, you must do an introduction to make sure it is a good match.  My dog loved Sayuri, but was not as fond of the other dog.  I like to say that my dog chose our new puppy :).  \n\nWhen adopting a puppy, you also recieve a free exam through the VCA Animal Hospitals.  I think that's wonderful since adopting a rescue dog can be intimidating.\n\nOverall, the facility is extremely clean, the staff is more than helpful, and on top of it all, they are about as friendly as you can imagine. These people have hearts of gold.  I would absolutely recommend the AZ humane society to anyone who wants to add to their family.","302":"This is for service only.  On a 2000 Honda Accord Vtec EX.  Had major service done here: 1. timing belt, water pump, tune up, etc.  Basically everything that was recommended and told needed to be done.  Wanted the car to be reliable and not have any issues so I went ahead with all the required maintenance and then some.\n\n1 month after all this major service the radiator blew open coming back from flagstaff.....Ok so I understand things break etc.  I take it to Arrowhead Honda Service and the explanation was since I replaced the water pump with a new one it must have increased pressure in the system. Since the radiator was old the new water pump found a weakness in the radiator.  I was then told it was common??? OK I get the explanation, but if that was the case a month a go and common knowledge why not recommend replacing the radiator with the major service so the car would not leave me stranded???\n\nThey also had recommended the power steering pump be replaced, system flushed etc.  Hate when its not done right the first time?  Had to bring it back and wait for them to get air out of the system so the new power steering pump would stop making noise.  \n\nI went to this dealership service department because they know Honda's better then me and what breaks, unfortunately even when I changed everything they initially recommended they still missed other items that should of been changed.  I have not been back since this mistake....","303":"Dr. Roach and staff are wonderful. Keisha is an amazing groomer too! We love this place. It is clean, efficient, and a state of the art facility.","304":"I love this location. Christina was our server this morning and she was fantastic. As a former waitress I understand how hectic and overwhelming a morning shift can get but she was attentive and very friendly and always kept her cool even with the tons of tables she had. \n\nThe food was brought to us within ten minutes of ordering (successfully taming the hangry beast that was brewing) and any modification to our order was done correctly! The food itself was pretty good. \n-- I highly recommend the banana nutella crepes. \n\nOverall I was very impressed with this recent visit. Keep up the good work!","305":"Good luck getting an appointment  before you end up in the E.R.","306":"I'm not into seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he loves it.. There were other options then seafood that made me happy...and my husband said his was great..","307":"This review is for just the gym facilities as I've never tried the tanning or purchased any products. There's a solid array of cardio equipment, weight machines, and free weights (including an Olympic lifting platform\/power cage combo with bumper plates, another power cage, and a Smith machine). \n\nThe pros: \n24 hours access with your keycard\nno-contract membership options\nlockers (bring your own lock)\nsweat towels provided\nfriendly employees \n\nThe cons: \nno showers\ninconsistent membership rates (my friends got quoted several different rates than what I pay) \nSmall space can get packed\nSome of the equipment is showing signs of wear (ripped pads on weight machines and cracks in the weight benches pads and the numbers have rubbed off on some of the dumbbells, so you can't tell what the weight is. I wouldn't think it would be that hard to slap some stickers on there but it's been that way for months. \noften dirty - especially the mirrors in front of the power cages which ALWAYS have peoples' spit sprayed all over them. I have personally wiped weird black\/brown splotches off the Olympic lifting platform (are people shitting themselves during squats??) and it's always built up again the next time I go.\n\nOverall it's a decent gym that gets the job done if you live in the area.","309":"My companion and I went to Living Kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it! My companion got the Arugula Harvest salad and I got the Pad Thai. The Arugula Harvest salad was very tasty and all of the components came together well. The Pad Thai was also very flavorful and had an awesome sauce which had a good afterburn to it. I would highly recommend coming here to try the food vegan, vegetarian, or otherwise.","310":"why do these guys suck? how hard is it to ring a bell to see if the receiver is home?  I've had multiple issues with them, and wish Amazon would stop using them.","311":"This place brings back so many memories with my family. It has been here for years and unfortunately the service and food quality has gone down. \n\nDuring my recent visit I noticed they closed down the second half of the seating area which is disappointing in my book. I go here with my family and we are usually big party so they would  accommodated just fine but now we had to separate the family and sit at different tables or booths just to all fit. Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years.\n\nThe service for the food depends on the day and if Glendale is hosting a event. I don't recommend lunch or dinner here but the breakfast is like any ordinary restaurant. I was on  cleanse one weekend and they were awesome enough to give me egg whites even though it wasn't on the menu.","312":"We went for brunch. Shrimp, sushi, snow crab legs, crepes made to order, prime rib, etc. etc. Add all you can drink mimosas and we were loving it. 76.00 for two after tip. Would go back for sure.","313":"This is the worst gym I've ever been to, and I've grown up in the gym business. These guys only care about your money and nothing more. When I joined I later had to cancel with them because I had to meet with my National Guard unit and I didn't know what kind of schedule I'd have. They seemed understanding and said it wasn't a problem. At this time I would have rated this gym very good, because I had fun with no issues. I even told them I'd probably start back up here after I know what schedule looked like. So I stop going after my month expired because I cancelled(even on my attendance sheet it said it was my last and only month.) I later check my bank statement and they charged me again, okay no big deal probably a mistake. I call them, no answer. Okay that's fine I'll email them explaining the mistake. I'll give them a few days to get back to me max. Hear nothing from them. Call them again, no answer. Call them again they finally answered. I explain the situation with guy that answers and he says \"Oh yeah i got your email but I forgot to call you.\". At this point I'm a little rubbed wrong with they're crap customer service. Then after that he tells me no I haven't cancelled and I'm going to have to pay another two months worth. He tells me I must have misunderstood him (he speaks broken English so he must have misunderstood me when I cancelled with him a month prior to this). He won't help me out at all, just says I have to pay more. Thank god I have Navy Federal for a bank because I call them after this and they let me know these guys shouldn't be changing me. They repay me for what the gym took and put a dispute on the gym, they also put a stop payment on the gym. Well sure and behold I get charged by them AGAIN and I call my bank asking why did this happen? Turns out this gym is manually putting my card information in to get past the stop payment. I ask what I can do. They say to email them so I have proof i contacted them in case they try to lie. So I email these dirt bags and guess what once again nothing but they email me the SCHEDULE FOR THE CLASSES. Once again my bank is helping me, thank goodness. Not veteran friendly.","314":"Freaking BOMB Macaroni & Cheese and Everything Else was Awesome as well great Service again everything was OUTSTANDING","315":"I ordered the Akropolis Pizza and Pork Gyro. The first thing I noticed when the pizza came out was how vibrant the toppings were! You can tell the veggies are fresh just by looking at them. The gyro was one of the best I've had and the fries were awesome. Great service! They really care about giving you a good experience. I will definitely be back!","316":"Worst experience ever.... I guess it's my first time left negative comments but definitely for me won't go back anymore. I have made reservation for the day and when I arrive they told me they don't remember they have confirmed my appointment n already other guests waiting there but they re closing in a hour. Still the lady told me it's ok they could do it. So I sit down n soak my feet into cold water... n after 20 mins, the lady told me n another girl that actually they could not help us today as they re closing soon n one of the staff actually have to leave soon... so I don't know how good they re as I guess I ll never know:(","317":"So let me start out. The ambiance of the facility is amazing.  Very classy.  But that doesn't compensate for the service I received.   I was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation.  I honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait.\nI was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me.  There has to be a Happy medium.   It's not right to let the \"sex sells\" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally. \nTo be honest I wish had just went to IHOP but I tried to be a good person and support black business.  \nThis place will not be recommended to anybody I know\nThe food on a scale of a 1-10 was a 7 if the service was better I'd give a 8.  My meal was the salmon and grits.","318":"Being an avid Hookah smoker with a pipe of my own I probably have a little more knowledge about Shisha and the procedures than I need, with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in, double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting.  They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right. \n\nMoving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere. Give this place a shot if you're near the area.","319":"Will not offer refund and will charge you for cancelled flight. Even a month in advance i tried and they will not work with me. Dont use this cut rate airline","320":"Better than hot & juicy and boiling crab.. They would have gotten 5 starts from me, but they forgot my crab legs! The main reason I wanted to come here.. It was disappointing, but the flavors are really good and the seafood was very fresh.. I love that they use real butter in the sauce and not margarine like all the other crawfish spots!! So this will be my new seafood spot..","321":"The nicest hotel I've ever stayed in in Vegas! Found a great deal during the week and couldn't pass it up. Clean, staff is friendly and there's so much food to choose from downstairs! Pretty convenient location on the strip as well. Definitely will stay here again.","322":"A wonderful dinner experience! Hubby and I came couple months ago, it was our first time at Sushi Samba. We didn't have reservations, but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar. \nWe had the A5 Wagyu gyoza, was tender and not overdone, Tuna tataki, Chicken Samba was a good size portion, El topo roll, chef sashimi selections, and Tonkotsu ramen. Everything we order was super yummy!  Definitely coming back again next time we're in town!!\nI would recommend making reservations next time, the sushi bar is kind of tight and if you order a good amount of food, not too much room.","323":"Danielle was the perfect server - always smiling and came around enough but not too much, made good suggestions and generally let us be silly, nearby table neighbors were great, food was fresh and tasty. I had the crab topped chicken which was juicy and flavorful. The man had ravioli something that was also tasty - fresh pasta and good meat sauce. \n\nThe salad and soup and breadsticks are always wonderful. We also got the bruschetta which was really perfect - not specialty, not gourmet, just perfectly normal, fresh tasting tomato, basil and olive oil yumminess.\n\nWe also had a trio of their Dolcini desserts which made it perfect so we could have tiramisu and the limoncello and strawberry stuff!\n\nOverall, even though it was really busy and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table (although 'waiting' in the bar having a drink hardly counts as waiting), with the excellent service and great food this place definitely gets 5 stars from me and for a chain restaurant that is definitely something!","324":"I'm truly disgusted by the service of this restaurant.  I came in with my family (Mom and Dad) and they said 10 minute wait, we said okay, we notice that they were short with their staff so we waited patiently till we were seated at a table, but that 10 minutes turned into a 30min wait. So the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait, after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn't exist, the hostess later seated another table which were 4 Caucasian customers, we were still patiently waited for around another 30min, when those 4 sat down an Asian waiter quickly came to take their order, I got the waiters attention and said excuse me, we came here first. And she made up an excuse saying how \"Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy\" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say \"Oh but they serve the people who come before\" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table\" she said it depends. So in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well, called Rice Paper.","326":"These are sooo good!  I'm having Bulgogi dog cravings right now!  So tasty!  Want to go back and try the carne asada fries too!  See you soon!","327":"Had the occasion over the last few weeks to experience their sports medicine\/physical therapy department.  Outstanding.  Drs. Anthony \"Tony\" Walker and Jennifer Hannon are a great team.  They really know their stuff.\n\nBeyond knowing their stuff is their continual dialogue with patients.  On each appointment we began discussing how the exercises were working, how I was feeling, what is working or not.  Then we would get into planning for that day and going forward.\n\nI was involved in the therapy.  And we continued in this joint planning over a month of treatments.\n\nThey administer a tablet form of survey asking about your condition and how it is affecting your life.  After the therapy has run its course you complete the same survey, so they have a before and after record of your condition.\n\nImpressive and given the people cycling through this practice it was clear that the facility and all the therapists were doing something special.\n\nGood resource for most all of us.","329":"This is such a great attraction!!! My 13 year old son loves all things Marvel - it made the highlight of our trip! Staff are very helpful and the venue makes you feel like you are in the middle of the movie!","330":"My family and I visited and decided to take some pictures with the green screen so they can edit in the Avengers in them afterwards. Since this was our first time visiting this place, the staff was very patient and helped guide us. When we went to go check out which ones to print, Agent Collins was a great help. We loved his easy going personality and he has great customer service! 10\/10 would visit again. The pics came out very nice too! Thank you, Agent Collins. Continue to show your awesome personality and great customer service! Very much appreciated.","334":"I have dined here Teppan twice, a la carte twice.\nThe teppan is very well priced and great food but the chef's are tired. Understandable. There is not the same type of showmanship you can get elsewhere but they are good chefs.\nA la carte sushi is great. Pot of soup is huge and delicious.\nThis is a local place that does well. Service was on point and very attentive last time I came here.","335":"Came in because our Toronto friends insisted on drinking some \"gator bait\" before we left to go home. This place screams New Orleans to me, and the service is friendly just like the south. We sat at the bar and drank and we were able to see them shuck oysters right in front of us, pretty cool. \n\nDidn't try the food but the menu looked tasty, will try it when we are back in town. But the \"gator bait\" drink was delicious!","336":"Absolutely no complaints! Stayed in the Bella Suite with a view. It was a fantastic room; amazing service and friendly staff. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is room service.  Yeah yeah I know and can expect to pay higher prices for room service food, but $34 for hot tea and doughnuts (OUCH!) They charge $5 for room service, but I think that should be free.","337":"The food here is the best Greek food I've had in Arizona. The prices aren't too bad and the service was great. They are really fast too!!","338":"This Pita Jungle is located in the food court at the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. Out of all the eateries in the food court, this is by far and away the healthiest. There are some vegetarian and vegan options for those looking for a meat-free dish. The lentil soup is super yum and they have some great dishes I haven't seen anywhere else. They have several locations in the valley. The one on Ray and Dobson has a patio right next to a small lake. It's a great location, but can get crazy busy, especially during lunch on the weekends or on gorgeous days.","339":"Went here on new years day to grab a burger. Got in before the OSU game started. Tasty $5 cocktails (in pint glasses, mind you) and good burgers. The fries have large grain salt and were well prepared. I had the Oh Cheesus, which is a burger to be reckoned with. Seems a bit like a rip off from Melt but I didn't care, it's a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches (with more cheese on top of the burger) \n\n\n...I made it healthier by adding spinach on top. Basically health food at that point.\n\nI'll be back!","340":"This is a really quaint place for the whole family!  Rows of pinball machines- some vintage, some modern. There are also other various arcade games like Super Mario Bros. and Centipede.  Crane games for all your plushie needs.  Coin machines to turn your bills into coins for the machines.  Vending machines in case you are feeling hungry or thirsty while you play.  Staff walks around to make sure machines are running as they should and refund you if one of them fails while you are playing.  Towards the back, there are more older pinball machines that seem to be out of order or in the process of restoration.. really neat to see!  I believe there is also a prize counter in the back though I'm not sure how that would work.  It is a dimly lit building which allows the lights of the machines to illuminate the area.. Great place to hang out and play some good ol' fashioned arcade games.","341":"I understand Las Vegas is over-priced.  But $50 for a pitcher of mediocre sangria - more than 1\/2 way filled with ice - with not a slice of fruit in sight?  ANNOYING.  \n\nFriendly staff.  My food (fish tacos) was not nearly as good as the time I had it before.  \n\nIt is conveniently located very close to the convention center so it gets packed when events are going on.","342":"Love coming back to this location, one of the best ones I've been to. Have tried other buffalo's and they don't top the service from the metro center store. We always get helped out by Chelsea and she is awesome always has a smile and makes us feel at home, also the team captains are always checking to see if we are good with our orders and drinks","343":"There are better and worse Y's for sure.  This place is nothing compared to Dowd or Davidson, but it does the job.  I would give another star, but I've just been told they are raising the already high price.  Plus, people don't seem to understand the one way signs in the parking lot, or just the parking lot in general.  I've def been honked and yelled at for following the rules.\n\nThe front desk help are always pleasant, once you get to them.  I normally don't have the best of interactions with other patrons while waiting in line, but that seems to be the idea on this side of town.\n\nThe locker rooms are decent, nothing special.  Plenty of open lockers most times of the day.  You will rarely find yourself solo in the sauna or steam rooms.\n\nI've only swam here once, I need to get on that.  I've never used the basketball courts or anything outside.  I stick to the weight room.  I have never had to wait on a bike or a treadmill.  If I'm looking for a stair climber that can be another story though.  The bikes are no where near as nice as the Dowd.  The only thing I ever have to wait on are the free weights.  There's plenty of weights, but not much room at all to use them.  If you want a lay down bench, you will probably have to wait, especially at peak hours.\n\nAll in all, it is what it is.  Its close, so this is where I go.  Plus, there is a 24 hour Harris Teeter right there where nobody looks at you funny for being sweaty in gym clothes.  But, If somebody calls me asking if I want to go to a nicer location, I do.","344":"Went here as a last resort because a hose on my son's truck busted and we were stuck. \n\nThey usually ask for a 24 hour turn-around, but because we had kids in the Nevada desert heat they made the hose with clamps, etc. in about 20 minutes. Great service and the part, which no auto parts store could replicate (strangely), was done perfectly.\n\nSuper nice guys, not expensive at all, and they really saved the day. Thank you, guys, you're awesome!","345":"The food was very good . The waitress was very inventive . The only thing is my I felt so sick after eating it . I'm not sure if it's just my stomach not being able to handle it or what but I felt terrible . The staff at the front was very friendly and talkative","346":"Looked forward to eating here for so long...too bad it was on my birthday - food was good but the service was deplorable so not going to rehash this too much (apologies to my man and bro as I know they were also hoping for better)\n\nThe appetizers were by far the best thing - the entree's were good with red meat being the star. \nPeach cobbler desert was all topping that I swear was merely microwaved and had one slice of grilled peach - putting a candle on it did nothing to make me think this was the birthday dessert I was for... \n\nI highly recommend the flight of 10, 20 30 & 40 yr old ports - this mellowed out the complete waste of skin that was our server. Not sure if he thought we looked unable to tip for a spendy bill or weren't as enthralled as the table next to us with his Montana stories but my brother aptly reconfirmed his tip expectation with 7% - too much in my opinion for not giving diddley about someone chosing their restaurant to celebrate in.","347":"Hy Steakhouse is a contemporary and elegant  traditional steak house, with lots of open space and an intimate dinning experience.\n\nWe started with the Famous Cheese Toast, oyster rockerfeller which was 6  sweet and savory but very small oysters.  And the beef tartare, which was made table side and served with small biscuits.\n\nWe ended off with the 22 oz. porterhouse steak, which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us.\n\nOur server was friendly and insightful, and always catered to our needs at the table, other servers were also helpful but tended to their own tables. Although there were several mistakes on our bill initially, such as wrong food and drinks and extra items being billed, our server fixed everything easily.\n\nThe room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate.\n\nIn conclusion, the food quality is above standard, service and cleanliness is high, and the atmosphere is intimate. The food is more old fashioned, come here for a great steak done right at a slightly higher price range than the keg.","348":"Mr Cool Heating and Air Conditioning came to the rescue for me on short notice AND was able to work on a swamp cooler, which many companies do not. \n\nWe have three dogs of our own and we foster dogs, so when it started to heat up here in Vegas we were worried when the swamp cooler didn't seem to be blowing out air as cold as it normally does. I started reading reviews and messaging companies on yelp to see who, if any, would work on Swamp Coolers. The answer is, very few do, and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate, and often that fee doesn't apply towards the repair cost. Mr Cool didn't charge me an estimate fee and they had Derek come out to my house the very next day. Derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like I was clueless. He offered his estimate for service and even told me I could shop around for other estimates to be certain I was getting a good price. I had already shopped around a bit so I was happy to proceed with their help. \n\nSwamp cooler parts are very large so they don't have space to keep them in their vans, but Derek assured me he could buy the parts and complete the repair the very next day. I explained that my husband and myself would need to wait until Friday when we were getting paid for repair and he was kind enough to work with us so we could come to an arrangement for payment so we wouldn't have to deal with our house being so hot. He came back the next day and was here for a good amount of time as swamp coolers take more time for repair and he was very thorough and explained everything to me again. I asked questions about how to best maintenance our swamp cooler and he was happy to answer. I'm very glad we chose Mr Cool and would HIGHLY recommend Derek as he was so patient, kind, and hardworking. Swamp coolers are a pain for repair so if they were affordable for our repair I'm sure they're even better with AC units. Thank you Derek and Mr Cool, our house gets soooo cold now, just how I like it!","349":"This place.  We are staying at the Legacy Golf Resort and that we would grab a quick bite there since we were driving by.  Such a fun atmosphere !  And, fantastic food that has a unique flare and is healthy.  I also like the casual environment where you can play outdoor games with the family. Highly recommend this spot!!!","350":"One of my favorite places to eat in town. They have the best bean dip I've ever had. The owner is so kind, and I highly recommend a margarita on the rocks and chicken tacos.","351":"First time ever coming here even though I live less than a mile away. I have to admit it was fantastic! I ordered the Surf & Turf taco plate. Both of the tacos were full of flavor and tasted very fresh. \nI got the Spanish rice instead of beans and it was delicious, not dry and over cooked like most places. \nThe young man at the register \"Chris\" was very helpful with ordering and extremely pleasant. I will definitely be coming back to check out the $1.50 tacos on Tuesday.","352":"So I once went to see Brent Spiner, the guy who played Data on Star Trek, talk at a convention (i'm cool) and he opened his little talk by telling us all about how the night before, he'd had a truly unique dining experience.  He went to Burrito Boyz.  His only regret?  Not getting a large.\n\nHe's pretty much bang on.  There's very little to regret when it comes to Burrito Boyz.  Their burritos are big and filled to the point of bursting with delicious flavours.  I usually go for the small, because the large really is very large, but I'll indulge once in a while.\n\nThey've got a variety of meats you can choose from.  Some favourite being chicken, halibut and beef.\n\nEverything is great really.  Even their level of spice, is always bang on for me.  You can request that they withhold certain things like hot sauce or jalopenos, but trust me, it's not that bad.","354":"Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.\n\nIt's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.\n\nService was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again.","355":"I am speechless. I am without words to properly describe this place. Everything about this place is amazing. The staff, the food, everything. I ate one meal today and I made it count by getting the 2-meat plate with brisket and ribs with grits and beans as the sides. The ribs had to be my favorite, but my mind was blown by the jalape\u00c3\u00b1o cheddar grits, and then lord the brisket and beans. Oh hell, who am I kidding I can't put these in any order. Eat everything here. I don't know who Bekke is, but she's got one hell of a pecan pie named after her.","356":"The best aged angus burger fed on carrots..... the staff is awesome too.... can't wait to go back....","357":"4.5 Stars\n\nAn extra star for the legendary Iraqi fish dish known as 'Masgoof.'  If you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq.  An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.\n\nIn most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because I don't love the almighty Kabob, it's because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.\n\nThe interiors and d\u00c3\u00a9cor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I've come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  I'm glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.\n\nHats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you'll meet.","358":"I have been going to this nail salon for 8 months now.  I only go to Ahn - she is so great!  Never once has she hurt me while cutting my cuticles.  I always get gel manicure & pedicure & she does a fantastic job!!   All tools are clean & sterilized and salon is pleasant  to be in.","359":"Too much food and not good for diabetics the food is delicious.  Just had a spread of the waffle, protein omelette, veggie omelette, brioche french toast and chicken and waffles between 6 of us.  Oh left off apple pancakes.  All great and Tracee was the best waitress. She leads a great happy birthday too.","361":"Jodi the salesperson design of the layout of the cabinets was excellent.\nJayson installed the cabinets professionally. \nThe staff and materials used high quality.","362":"Wow! So fresh, ripe, and sweet! And right in my back yard! I have watched customers go in and out of this small location in the strip mall and always wanted to try this! So glad I did! Can't wait to come back and try everything else!","363":"I'm so..... Heated... I bought the 3 amigo and it was amazing.... I can't believe they'd serve me something this good","364":"I should have listened at the other reviews for this place. I got the Hopeful Signature Poke Bowl and it was very bland, and didn't quite sit right in my stomach. Maybe too much sauce? It is comparable to  having salmon sushi ingredients in a bowl with way too much rice. It's too bad, because I love poke bowls and had high hopes for this place. 2 stars for the nice interior.","365":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. They are RUDE, unprofessional and they have personal lockers that you HAVE to put your purse in to shop with them. I was asked to go and put my purse in my car. Excuse me?! Is this even legal? Are you going to replace my purse and it's contents if someone steals my personal items? I'm not sure who is running this place but this insane policy is CLEARLY negatively impacting you business. BAD move, BAD business move. Go across the street to Sally's.","366":"One of my favorites for cheap, fast and tasty Mexican! It's definitely low-key and casual, but for a scrumptious chimichanga with terrific queso and a heavy-on-the-tequila margarita, this place has it all!","367":"Amazing. In Phoenix for the #bmophx marathon. Feet felt like I had run 26.2 miles alright this morning. Stopped by for a foot massage and these guys are amazing.\nWalked out of there feeling like I had two new feet!\nI have had foot massages all over the country and these guys are top two or three for sure!","368":"I have a confession to make... I have an obsession with tongue.\n\nThat's right folks - tongue. I love it. Name the animal - duck, pig, cow - it's definitely one of the best eating parts of the animal. (what, were thinking about something else? You guys have dirty minds ;P  !) Being Asian, my parents indoctrined this love at a very early age.\n\nWhen I discovered that Jewish delis were into tongue too (and liver, yum!), I pretty much loved hitting up inexpensive places to nosh.\n\nI was kind of depressed in Vegas because... well, on the Strip, you pass by all these famous delis that basically rape your wallet.\n\nYou can imagine how happy I was to find the Bagel Cafe! \n\nMy hubby got the pastrami and I ordered the tongue sandwich. Perfection. Really. And not hard on the wallet either which is the best part.\n\nI did try a slice of Boston Creme cake and it is totally junky good.","369":"Fair pricing. Quick response. Great junk removal. Brandon gets it done.","370":"Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in ages.  The service was glacial.  I ordered a house salad, but was told not all the ingredients listed on the menu were available.  I ended up with a plate of arugula and a tomato with some not-so-tasty French dressing  We waited for over an hour for the main course to arrive--General Jackson's Chicken.  The menu promises:  \"Boneless, marinated chicken deep fried and tossed in spicy, savory sauce, served with jasmine rice, broccoli and napa\"  Spicey sauce?  This sauce was so spicy I was unable to even taste the chicken.  The rice was strictly Uncle Ben's and i saw no broccoli or napa.  We had a couple beers before the meal while waiting.. Total bill:  $55.  I'm not a tightwad, but dinner in a little strip mall restaurant should not set you back $55--or else it should be delectable.  Battiste and Dupree was not the \"hidden gem\" others had told me about.  Hope your mileage differs.","371":"Good, clean place to get a mani\/ pedi. The two came to $39 with tax and they did a great job of both. TVs all over so you can watch tv and freindly staff. \n\nWill be going back for my next mani\/pedi.\n\n**** UPDATE*****\n\nThe great manicure that I got here lasted all the way through my vacation to Mexico without  so much as a chip! This was a regular manicure and not done with shellac.\n\nOnly now, after two days back to work and polishing mad silverware, is it starting to chip. I'm upping the stars from my former 4 to 5.\n\nVery impressed and will be returning with friends :)","372":"Interior is super cool and chill & the place has numerous decorative pieces if you look carefully.\nI had Harajuku and Penicillin & they are amazing especially the penicillin. The dash of Islay really takes it to the next level.\nAll the bartender look very passionate & our main bartender Joseph was amazing.\nDef worth stopping by.","373":"Great food and have good vegetarian options. Always busy  lots of great sauces to choose from","374":"First time buyer,\nI was excited to go in buy my first car the last week of November 2014. At the beginning the owner was very nice and was giving all the details of the car I bought a Mini Cooper. Knowing that it had issues in the transmission. Witch he promised he would cover with and insurance ASC warranty a Vehicle Protection Plan within three months or 3000 miles. I contacted him several times for him to get my car fixed he kept saying that he would fix it after the holidays. January, February passed the car was not fix yet. I contacted him one las time, I told him that I would give him one more month than he told me that he has been working on it still. He told me that it was an imported part witch was not easy to find. I told him I will take legal action and he than answered with '' do whatever you have to do'' with a arrogant tone so unprofessional till now I can say that he has NEVER!!! Contacted me!!! To keep me updated or give me a solution. I believe I have been more than patient at this time it is incredible how they claim to be a legal business. I will be contacting him again and demand a solution. I highly suggest you think twice about going here. I have read another review regarding several comparable issues. I have never had this experience and it is horrible driving your first car with a bad transmission.\nI really want to warn you do not go here!!! \nI have never written a review but I really want let people know that these people are committing fraud!!!\n\n\n\nBE AWARE OF THIS LOCATION!","375":"I was very disappointed with the customer service from the server to the owner which really surprised me, what a BITCH!  I ordered a western omelet with hash browns crispy and when I got the omelet there was no cheese in it. The hash browns were barely cooked. In addition, we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, \" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy\".  But guess what none of that happened!  I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills. In addition, when paying for my food I was told that they only take cash so I had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn't sit well with me, I almost said screwed it, but my conscience said don't do it, so I went back and paid my bill.  Long story short, if you want good customer service and u want good food I would recommend going to Denny's or Bob Evans. Oh yeah one more thing, if no stars were a choice I would have put none!!!","376":"Let's just say I'm shocked. People are super friendly. have other food then donuts! It close to my work. Price isn't too bad it is reasonable. It's a great place to relax and get some work done","377":"I really enjoyed Ashley and Ami Salon. She did a great job, was friendly, and professional. I usually get my hair done when I go to MI because of the quality of the highlights and the price.  The price was very affordable, and the highlights. FANTASTIC!\n\nThanks Ashley. i highly recommend you and Ill be back.","378":"Brandy was amazing! Loved her personality and that she made all of us feel welcome at the studio! She is a great technician to boot! Highly recommend seeing this place if you're interested in great photos of your baby!","379":"I have been to Vintner Grill twice in two weeks recently.  The first was on Administrative Professionals' Day for lunch.  It was packed and the food was delicious.  As is the usual with Vintner, the service was not great.  Our waiter was friendly (when we saw him), but he just couldn't keep up in his section.\n\nHubby and I also went back on a Friday at 2:15 for a liquor lunch, and I must say it was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Las Vegas.  The food was excellent as it has always been.  However, for the first time, the service (by Mark), was impeccable.  Was it because there were only a few tables?  Possibly, but something tells me that I have found my go-to server from now on.  He made great recommendations, and the timing of everything was amazing.  Sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly.\n\nPlease go to Vintner Grill.  It is worth the drive from the Strip.  Just be patient in case the service is a little slow.  Besides, you never know what celebrity you may see!","380":"WHOA!\n\nRed Carpet handles business.  No WAIT No LINES No HASSLE,  seriously though.  Why worry about lines in Vegas when you can pregame in the room and immediately step into the club?!?!  \n\nI'd give them a million stars.\n\nWalked into XS -no problem-       9 dudes\nWalked into EBC- no problem-    9 dudes\nCrazy huge 30 passenger limo- GMC Kodiak or something-   Ridiculous\n\nCouldn't have made my bachelor party better.  I will be using them again and again for as long as I live when I come to Vegas.  All their staff is great with email or phone correspondence, thank you Annie!!\n\nYou cannot go wrong with them.  Shell out the extra dough and book your Vegas clubbing experience, you wont be disappointed.","381":"I've never been to Akina for their AYCE dinners, only for their WONDERFULLY priced bento box set lunches.\n\nTheir bento boxes are all set at $5.99.  They come with miso soup, salad, and 3 Cali-rolls.  The boxes themselves are large and usually have like 3-4 different things in them (i.e. Tofu, mixed veg, main course, rice).\n\nValue wise, this has got to be one of the best lunches you can get for $5.99.","382":"These guys literally saved me.  I had a RFP due during the holidays.  With my computer and printer crashing, I was in a serious bind.   I usually go to Staples Printing Centers-- but, they couldn't get it done in time.   So, I got on the Peoria Chamber website and International Minute Press\/Desert Sky Printing came to the rescue.  They finished my printing and the RFP was turned in with 1 hour to spare.  I recommend them highly!","383":"Great-tasting deep dish pizzas.  They make a mean calzone as well.  I'm a little sad that they don't use fresh mushrooms.","384":"I am never disappointed with this place. I've yet to eat at the restaurant but the ahi bar is amazing! I always come in to get the spicy ahi bowl and a few sides of ahi. So yummy!","385":"A must go destination in Phoenix.\nChinese - Mexican - Jamaican Fusion Fast Casual (or as I like to call it - Confusion!)\nIt's a Phoenix original.  It's been on Diner's Dives and Drive Ins.\n\nIf it's your first time, go up to the counter (to the left of the cash registers) and ask for the orientation - they'll walk you through the ordering process, and give you samples of several of the dishes.  After you do that, grab an order form and pick a 2 item combo and choose 7 9 Black and White.  That's all your really need to know.  :-)  That's Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Black Beans and White Rice.  Jade Red Chicken is sort of their take on sweet and sour, but with a spicy twist.  Jerk Chicken is Jamaican influenced (and can be quite spicy some days).  The Black Beans are amazing - stir them into your rice (easier to eat both with your chopsticks when you do this).  And, did I mention, you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  Yep!  Best snickerdoodles around, and one comes with every dish!\n\nIf you haven't been to Chino's - it's time - make a run for the border\/great wall\/beach!\n(and make sure to read the non-PC T-shirts while you wait - funny!)","386":"I think when the first people I encountered was courteous and friendly then the critic inside of me melts a little, the front desk was very helpful and friendly, the therapies were excellent.  I even decided to join their wellness program because it's very accommodating and manageable for my expenses.","387":"Terry (the owner) has been fixing my car for years and has done consistently great work. I completely trust his opinion when he tells me what he thinks is wrong or what the course of action should be. I have seen many of his projects over the years in many different stages of completion and they always look and run superbly. The shop itself is always full of cars from all different decades in for all different types of work, and the reception area is all made up in a tiki-type theme so when you visit you will definitely have something cool to look at while you wait. I would recommend this shop to anyone with an old car that needs fixing, whether that means getting an oil change or having major restoration work done.","388":"This is one of my favorite places to eat.  The food is delicious, fresh and almost everything can be made with tofu as a substitute.  The owners are very friendly and the food truly is superb!","389":"We were recommended this Vet by a friend who has gone to him for years; and we are not disappointed.\n\nDoctor Youssef first helped my boyfriend when his cat had a horrible hairball stuck in her stomach. He shows so much compassion and understanding for animals it is hard not to believe he truly cares for their well being.\n\nHe is not afraid to tell you if you are harming your pet. If they are overweight, he will tell you straight up and let you know you are causing them harm. If you are an uptight suburbian, then don't go to him. He will tell you that you are killing your dog feeding them 'Puppocinos'. Which you are.\n\nI started taking my dog here after she expressed her hatred of her previous vet, who felt that it was 'no big deal' and that they could always just muzzle her or sedate her for check ups. I felt that was ridiculous and brought her to Doctor Youssef who felt the same and is doing everything in his power to make her comfortable with him and his staff. He has even let me take her around the whole building just to get use to it. \n\nHis prices are very fair, and he himself is the most trustworthy vet I have yet to meet. One conversation with him and you can tell he does not care about money, he is truly one of the very few who are in this business just because they care about animals.\n\nI love this guy so much I recommended him to my best friend when she got her cat, and she takes it to him as well. She got the cat spayed and he offered to keep it overnight for free!\n\nIt is a drive away for me, but is well worth it. I would drive to Boulder City if I had to just to keep this guy as my vet.","391":"Went for Saturday Brunch. Wait was doable compare to other buffets. We paid about $38\/person which was standard for Vegas buffet. However, everything was underwhelming, nothing really stood out from their selection. For the price and to pay just a little extra, I'd recommend Wicked Spoon or Bachannal","392":"Pita jungle is one of our family's favorite places to go for a quick, fresh, healthy meal. The kids love the chipotle chicken flatbread and I am addicted to the Moroccan gazpacho! We feel great when we leave and usually try make better food choices for the rest of the day!","393":"I've been a happy client for several years! Ashlee takes time and ultimate care to do an outstanding job every time. I receive tons of compliments on my lashes and how natural they look. Ashley is a true lash artist. I'm 100% satisfied every time!","394":"I LOVE THEIR CHICKEN STREET TACOS!!!  Btw this Rubio is inside the Monte Carlo ( MGM Resorts employees like Aria,Vdara,Luxor,Mirage etc..) gets 15% off just show your employees I.d.","395":"I went here  they were about to close but the cashier was especially helpful ..but I guess they were tired of work...","396":"Brandi is awesome... love her demeanor and personality. She is an excellent stylist.. I am also a cosmetologist so I know  the real deal when I see one! I will be back again for sure! Her scalp message was perfection.. so relaxing and I had a blast talking \"shop\" with her. Highly recommend this lady!","397":"Chad installed a new heavy door for me which required modification and specialized hardware. His work was excellent and precise and completed sooner than expected. He was very polite, knowledgeable, and trustworthy. I will definitely offer all my future work to him and have already recommended him to my friends.","398":"To start, its a beautiful venue. Definitely a hidden gem in the GTA. But please be very very careful and get everything in writing. George Christakis the co-owner of this venue and manager of Crystal Fountain is very devious and sketchy. \n\nWe had checked out a few venues, one being Crystal Fountain, where we met George. He was definitely rude, and lacked professionalism. We left with a very bad impression.\n\nFast forward a few week, and we spotted Estate banquet, we emailed and arranged to meet up. We showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen, having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us. The venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details. My girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of George, whom I later found out when I asked is indeed the same George from Crystal Fountain.\n\nWe called George the next day to discuss food options, and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed. Tasting was included for 6 people. I asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone. When the email arrived it simply had generics such as \"assorted veggies, assorted cakes, hors d'oeuvres\" as well as a tasting for 2 people. As well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price.\n\nWhen we called back to discuss, he verbally told us again what it would include, but when I asked him to email us specifics, he refused. In a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field, and he does not give specifics. That grilled veggies, will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives, almost a year later. That it's his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide. \n\nNeedless to say, I told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying, we would be walking away. He said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing, and that we were to trust him. We walked.\n\nPlease be very wary of this George, he is very unscrupulous. The venue itself it nice, and private, but no way was I going to ruin such a special day by getting involved with such shady business dealings.","399":"I bought a house that had a safe with a dial.type lock which while definitely secure is a bit slow to open and makes me want to use the safe less often. I did have a business card from The Safe Keeper attached to opening instructions that was left by the seller. I went online, found their website and emailed them regarding changing to an electronic lock. They replied in the affirmative the next morning. I called and scheduled the work which was done within two days of my first contact. The service technician, Vid, was on time, knowledgeable, very personable and completed the changeover in the timeframe he had quoted even while explaining everything about the safe, the locking mechanism and answering all my questions.\nThis was a great experience with a top notch company. I couldn't be more pleased.","401":"Believe the negative reviews. I came here after a round of golf, in order to have dinner and a few brews. The service wasn't terrible, it was non-existent. The waiter seemed to take an eternity to take our order. \n\nI ordered the Penne with Italian sausage, only to find out, they were out of sausage. The waiter suggested an alternative. I went ahead and ordered it. What I ended up with was penne with canned tomato sauce and what I swear was frozen meatballs. At $12...what a shame.\n\nAs I'm done with my food and beer, I wasn't asked if I wanted anything else, my check was just dropped off. Service and food were bad, I will never return.","402":"Love this pub. The food is not great but if you stick to the pub grub faves. You should be fine. The best part about this place is the staff! All the girls that work here are amazing! :)","403":"Very simple,  yet very tasty wraps.  Corn chowder soup was ok, but the Ravi soup was great with lots of authentic Indian spices.","404":"We love Johnny Rockets. I am not sure what goes on at this location-or if it was just an off day-but the chicken sandwich was inedible. It tasted like nuked chicken. \n\nThe shakes were the normal quality-great shakes. Servers were very kind-would have been a one star but not for these two positives. \n\nOur recommendation is to pass on this location. Not a fair example of a typical Johnny Rockets quality.","405":"I had a Engine in warranty from LKQ, these guys were to install its replacement.. They told me done in a few days, ok...   I went there and noticed when the engine was taken out they carelessly left my AC dangling and did not remove it to install new engine. No big deal till you understand the rest.. this is a cheap way to not refill system and do it right...  After going to get my car when they said it was done I Notice AC didn't work and wrong Coolant added to Radiator. ( cannot use regular Green... Yellow Ford required ) Then I say I will come get it when they fix the AC, they tell me hours later its the PCM..( Computer ) well OK you guys shorted it out, the only thing wrong was a Valve Rattle, now this?? After 2 days with LKQ saying they are going to send a inspector I drove past and noticed my Mirrors Loose (broken ) on BOTH SIDES!! I am ANAL when it comes to my car I bought New in 2007..  this was enough, I took it home.. I had enough...  They forgot 4 bolts, 2 in wrong spot, One Digging into Power Steering Rack, Power steering Bottle Cracked on Bottom from a Poor removal and hid the fact it was cracked on the lower nipple and the AC system they claimed did not hold R-134a because they DID remove the AC later and LOST the O-Rings when they filled it, it leaked.. and they SHORTED the AC Protective Diode.. IT WAS NOT THE PCM.. this place MIGHT be good for a Oil Change if you tell them how to do it, but that's all..  Telling me How Do we know you didn't bring it in here like this... BAHAHAHA, a back yard weekend mechanic was able to figure out they were unskilled for the task.. I will make sure with a HUGE online review on EVERY Review site that this place is NOT the place to take a Car... or a peddle bike for that matter..\n\nI replaced the o-rings, pulled the diode and got the ac working after I vacuumed it and refilled, what armatures..  I guess I got to go to ford, spend $80 on a new Power steering Bottle and tell LKQ to send me the money..\n\nWhen they first got my car knowing it was under warranty from LKQ they tried to get me to pay them the other $45 per hour on top of the $55 an hour they were getting under warranty... I told them do not touch it until I contact LKQ, they tried to scam me out of $45 an hour x12 hours.... I am not stupid..  LKQ should have pulled it out right there and then, but no.. they agreed to do it for the $55 an hour, but the skill these guys have isn't worth Minimum wage..","407":"Cannot praise this place enough!!  If there were 10 stars, I'd give them a 10 star rating.  I called them about some custom lighting I needed for my handicap van and they scheduled an appointment for me to come in and see Jay for advisement.  The service was impeccable, the pricing was reasonable, and they were honest.  I plan to go back for some other custom work and will be letting everyone I know what a great place this is to deal with.  It's a nice relief when you find a great business when there are so many questionable businesses these days.  Highly recommend!!","408":"I placed a large takeout order (almost $100) late on a Thursday night and the gentleman made me repeat every part of the order at least twice. He didn't even bother to tell me what time the order would be ready. I frequent this place for lunch and use them for work events pretty frequently and have always had a decent experience but not this time.\n\nWhen I got home and went to unpack the food, I realized the order was completely wrong. Checked the receipt and the order that was rung in was completely different then what I asked for and with totally different quantities. It was as if the order was erased and the guy just tried to make it up out of memory. Certainly was not please to have ordered mainly calzones and end up with almost all subs.\n\nThe most annoying part of the experience is the sausage, pepper and onion subs were 85% peppers and onions. There was about 10 slices of very very thin sausage on the entire sandwhich which I think is a ripoff for $8.99. Terrible experience overall and will highly make me reconsider ever going here again.","409":"Authentic and Rustic full of ambiance.. Great for families aswell as romantic dinners.. Ahhh the memories","411":"New to Calgary, we did our homework on line and settled for Capo for one of our first meals out. Did not disappoint! A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as \"butter\" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates!\nThe end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came. What a gem of an eatery if you can afford to splurge now and then! A highlight of my week and would recommend to anyone!","412":"Never had Belizean food or have heard of them and they're right in front of my building for 7 months. Finally made my way over there and it's so dang good! Chicken fell off the bone. I ordered tamales since it's the special right now and it's huge for $5.50! Why did I wait so long! I was skeptical at first didn't know what to expect. Owners are super nice.","413":"Fajitas on Fire.  5 beers in a bucket for $15. Good chips and Salsa.  Mariachi Band.  Strategic TV's for all seats.  Excellent Margaritas. Kid friendly. This place rocks!!!\n\nOut of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food, drinks, and music, we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!  \n\nWe arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!  \n\nWe met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!\n\nThe Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!  \n\nThis is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!","414":"Drive-thru style smog station conveniently located close to the DMV.  I had a bit of trouble finding it via google maps- it's behind the 7-11 across the street from Smith's. Super quick service, I was done in about 5 minutes. 10\/10 would recommend.","415":"Over priced nasty nachos. The meat was so salty I couldn't eat them. And they tried to sell me a regular bottled water for $7. I will never go to this place again!!! This place sucks!!","416":"After a day of shopping at the local mall and with dinner still hours off, a friend and I popped into Grazie (based on a recommendation from a former Phoenix resident) for a snack.  Didn't hurt that my hotel was just up the street.  After a quick review of the menu, pizza seemed the best option and settled on the Capricciosa (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Artichokes, Olives, Mushrooms, Salame, Ham, Parmigiano Reggian).  The pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot, with a slightly burnt crust.  It lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies.  \n\nWine list is all-Italian and well priced, with many by the glass selections.  I opted for a nice Barbera, which was poured generously into a large glass.\n\nI'd be a regular if living in the area.","417":"Was amazing the first visit (when corporate was still overseeing their operations during the first few weeks of opening). The second visit was horrible.  We won't be returning. The salads were watery and tasteless, the fries were old burnt and overseasoned, the restaurant was dirty and the tables sticky, and the staff was impatient and unprofessional.","419":"Unfortunately, I don't understand the negative reviews, maybe it was bad timing? But I LOVED the crazy burger. I brought my American friend and he had the Green burger, and was impressed about how good it was. SUPER friendly staff, they made sure I had every condiment (ketchup, napkins etc.) I didn't expect any service at all from a burger joint but it was an pleasant addition. I'll be coming back for the food and the exceptional service. I've never had such a nice experience at a burger joint before. I'd recommend the Crazy Burger combo (Onion rings and Boylan's Black Cherry Soda). Although it was a bit messy it was delicious, and I loved every single bite of it. I'll definitely be coming back soon.","420":"Listen people this is the spot. Stop paying too much at over priced place where the portions are small and mash potatoes are green. This place portion size it meant to feed a horse not a mouse like the other places. Like I'm coming back here over and over again. Plus my gf lives not far is its convenient.","421":"Had a fantastic experience dining at Olive & Ivy! Believe it or not, we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the August Scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well.\n\nWent with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed! \n\nI had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate! \n\nThe focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an \"ice cream bar,\" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.\n\nOlive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!","422":"I really like this bookstore for its DVD and music selections. There's a nice clearance section with top end DVDs going for only two dollars. The staff here is very pleasant, and it's clean and well organized. I can't speak for their book section, as I have yet to shop for books here. They also have gadgets, which is nice. It's easy to find parking outside. My one complaint, if any, would be that they apparently don't check for the regions of their DVDs. I've purchased several which weren't made for the US region, so it was a total waste of money. Overall, I really like shopping here, and I'd recommend it to anyone who asked.","423":"third time I have had my eyelashes done, good service, awesome staff, reasonable prices...highly recommend!","424":"Terrible customer service , overprice , only one mechanic at the shop , 3 weeks to fix my bike ; owner dale kieffer so rude I never come back again.... Yamaha dealer same price excellent service","426":"Ping Pang Pong has always been an outstanding choice in terms of Chinese food here in the valley. What is so surprising is that most Chinese restaurants inside the hotels & casinos really are sub-par. The very basic essence of clean, fresh and friendly is the definition here, and the food is quite authentic. The servers work quite hard and there is a decent presence of managenent staff to ensure smooth operations. The XO sauce is very tasty, but be careful if you order it on the side as they will charge you for it (not exactly cheap). Still, I have been quite pleased with the food & service upon every visit for a number of years now. Definitely recommend -","427":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. We have had issues here before with being seated (it took them 15 minutes when the place was empty one time), but tonight takes the cake. \n     We went to get food at 2am, pulled into the drive thru at 2:32. We waited there for 15 minutes, then we got trapped in the drive thru by a curb and other vehicles for 25 more minutes. I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in. \n     I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave. All he said is \"I don't know if they shut down the drive thru but I can take your order here.\" Like THAT DOESNT HELP US. We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.\n     After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are \"backed up inside\", but they weren't at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing. I yelled \"are you getting paid for this?\" Through the speaker and he had time to answer and tell me to CALM DOWN but couldn't take my damn order.\n     We finally left with out even PLACING an order after 49 minutes. Will not return and by the other reviews for this place, I should have checked yelp before ever coming here in the first place. Went to the Mentor one after and got served right away.","428":"Decided on Valley ENT because my insurance provider covered them and they were conveniently located. I needed a quick appointment and didn't want to wait several weeks. I took a gamble and picked first available, which was Dr. Chuang. After I made my appointment, I began reading reviews on Valley ENT and Dr. Chuang. I couldn't have disagreed more on the negative reviews. Both Valley ENT and Dr. Chuang were professional, courteous, thorough and friendly. I will enthusiastically recommend both to anyone looking for quality healthcare. I strongly endorse them. They were excellent.","431":"I didn't listen to the low reviews, I wish I did. Literally the worst. We went through two of their routers that both broke. One didn't get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for, I called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router. Finally got the replacement and things seemed okay, but no, it completely broke in less than a month. It won't even turn on anymore. They suggested we go buy a new router from Best Buy, who btw doesn't sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? They charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn't work properly! Every time you chat with them you get different answers and they transfer you to about 10 people before they even get close to answering your question. \nDo not use this service, it might be cheaper but not cheap enough to deal with all this BS they put you though.","432":"Great food and prices.  Servings are generous and the atmosphere is good.  A nice place for traditional Mexican in Old Town.  Really liked the Pollo Relleno.","433":"Below average food. The service can be spotty, depending on the time of day.\n\nJust..look elsehwere. I'm surprised they are still in business.","434":"Paco's Tacos is the real deal! In spite of the great Yelp reviews, I still had my reservations about eating at another TexMex chain. How good could it be I thought? Well they totally nailed it, from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!\n\nThe dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch. Adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu. I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice, mixed cabbage coleslaw and, their own, Charro style pintos, all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic. \n\nPremeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately. The chips are very thin and were very fresh. The place was clean and attractive. Sanitation rating was a 95. For those long time Charlotteans like myself, you may remember this place as the old Manzetti's.\n\nI'm going back soon! This place is a Gotta Try!.","435":"While I don't have a green thumb, I very much enjoy having low-maintenance plants around the house. It's nice to be able to walk into a bonafide garden centre and proclaim, \"I just want a plant that's hard to kill,\" without the judgment! I've consistently found that the staff are helpful and courteous. What's best is that they stand by their plants with a 3 month satisfaction guarantee!","436":"The food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts, both were done correctly. The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special, the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers, two sides, two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm....","437":"We used to come pretty frequently when it was Joey's. When they changed over to North and South, we were a bit apprehensive about the addition of bbq and stayed away. It took a Yelp event to introduce us to the owners and the ways and whys of North and South. It was great  talking with them about what's new and learning about the cooking processes. We decided to try it out again after tasting their amazing St Louis ribs. We loved eating the ribs so much, I wanted to get a smoker. But why bother, when you can save time by ordering by the pound! I've never been much of a ribs person, but the entire family goes ga-ga over the ribs. It's like a \"don't you dare touch my leftovers\" kinda feeling after eating here. The waitress\/hostess we had was pretty awesome too. Her positive attitude and the info she provided about menu items made it a comfortable environment for us. We'll be back!","438":"i did not stay at this hotel but i did visit the hotel and the shops. Beautiful place!!!! not too crowded, very quiet and peaceful... I love this place. This hotel is located on the strip on the north end.. It's less crowded on the north and there is a mall right across the street. This hotel has many high end stores for shopping such as LV, Cartier, etc, but there is a regular mall across the street with Macy's, forever 21, etc..  The gondola rides are nice, but short!! it's 19.95 a person and it's 10mins long. They can stay in doors and out doors with the gondola. I heard out door is better at night because of the lights. Great overall experience, wonderful restaurants, awesome shops..","439":"Maybe because it was rainy outside, or the bartendress was on the rag, but the service I experienced was ATROCIOUS. This is after only my second experience here. My first experience was in the summer where I hung around the bar (on the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat on) and things were pretty cheery.\n\nThis time I ordered from the happy hour menu & apparently when you do this, you must sit at the bar---lame. The bartendress was in a super bitchy mood and poked fun at the fact that I was ordering from the happy hour menu. HELLO? We're not all snobby rich middle-aged Myers Park folk. I prefer beer & I wanted some Olde Mecklenburg Brewery Mecktoberfest, but the bartendress convinces me it isn't good because it's the last of the keg. Great. Personally, I don't do cheap beer, and nothing else looked good, so I stuck with water. At this, she snickers, \"so just water and some apps.....MMMKAYY\" while giving stink eyes. Excuse me? Who pissed in your cornflakes, lady? \n\nEventually the order comes in: Risotto fritters, Gouda grilled cheese and tomato fondue, koby beef sliders, weird salmon dip. All that was pretty good, no complaints there. This was the whole reason I came in the first place.\n\nNEEDLESS TO SAY I LEFT A GOOD TIP BECAUSE I'M THAT KIND OF A GUY. But honestly, this woman did not deserve one stinking penny, and I'll probably never go back here because of her attitude. It's sad to say because I live in this neighborhood and I like supporting this neighborhood's businesses. \n\nI work with all sorts of people on a daily basis, and work for tips myself, and it benefits no one when you bring your foul mood to the table, in fact it only detracts from possible future business.","440":"Excellent service quality.. I bought my car here and this is my car's first oil change service. They are very professional. I definitely recommend this place.  Since I bought my car here, they did everything free for first time. I checked the receipt and the prices are decent when compared to other auto service centres.","441":"Out shopping (gross), I got a hankering for Mexican food, and Border MX was the best rated option that came up.\n\nOverall, food was pretty good (chimichanga al pastor, flag enchilladas, and guacamole and chips) - though it was really slow coming out (despite not being busy), and the enchiladas were not as hot as my missus expected they would be. That said, drinks (including really good micheladas) were good, the guac was excellent, and overall, we left pretty happy (they Yelp special churros were a nice touch) - not an area I'm in a lot, but definitely impressed me with the authenticity - it was just the lag and the temperature of the food that was a little off.","442":"If you like thin greasy pizza, then Alexander's Pizza is good for you. The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza. The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil. \n\nAlexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. Not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard.","443":"Lovely food. I am also happy to eat at this location of paradise bakery.. they have fresh ingredients and make good alterations if asked for. Great for vegetarians and well as non vegetarians.\nFact that this location is in tempe marketplace, makes a high difference so we can enjoy outdoor seating in evenings.","444":"I loved my little cake, but the owner is her own worst enemy to her business. A friend took me there because we went on a cupcake tasting that day. He said a better product was awaiting me as the grand finale. When I walked in the store, I didn't know who the owner was, until my friend pointed it out when we left. I wanted to take a look around, it was nicely decorated, but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying. I explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake. I explained again that I was not from Scottsdale and am only one person. So I'm not going to buy a large cake. When we started talking a bit more, I could see her employees sort of clam up. I had no idea what was going on. When I chose my little cake, any sort of customer service went out the window once the money transaction occurred.  She didn't even say, \"Thank you,\" It was so unusual for a bakery or any business dealing with customers. I was upset and quite frankly, so angry that I wanted to turn around an return my cake and tell the owner to keep my money. I am not rich - I am passionate about bakeries and tour around when I'm in a new town to support local business. I was genuinely interested in hearing about the seasonal cake that she was trying to sell me. I had heard through other locals that they love the cakes, but not the owner when she's in the shop because she's so rude. I give this a two stars because I liked the cakes, but the service was very, very caustic that I could not justify scoring more. She cuts people off  - that was feedback I had received from previous customers. My local friends said that they cannot build rapport with the service workers there because there is always a new person. That made me wonder what was going on. I was trying to figure out how she stayed in business, but then heard she has a contract that keeps her afloat to sell cakes to a prominent medical clinic. I love the cakes there - the store is creative, but I sense a level of stress that turned me off. If it's the economy, that's one thing, but in the U.S., customer service is not taken lightly and I will probably seek out another Nothing Bundt Cakes for the product, but not return due to the principle of how rude the service was.","445":"Having dined at many other Vegas buffets (the Wynn, the Paris, the Mirage, etc.) I found myself very underwhelmed. Everyone raves about the Bellagio buffet but I just kept wishing I had gone to the Wynn.\nThe decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.\nI will say that the fruit was fresh and yummy (melon, berries, etc.) and the desserts were good, but it wasn't enough to make me want to come back here ever again.","446":"I had two different experiences with Carpet Monkey. In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also, they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs, hallway, stairs, and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09\/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09\/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09\/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn't satisfied at all with Mark's work. He said he'll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09\/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he's on his way, again great communication. I didn't worry too much that it wasn't Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn't expecting. There were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn't do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze. Thank you Isaac and Rick!","447":"Mike and his crew did a very good job on our backyard waterfall. I waterfall is about 20 years old and had a lot of cracks and was leaking water. We also had part of a palm tree growing out of the stonework. He was very knowledgeable and experienced. Prompt to the minute! And we felt he did a very good job with his crew. He was on site most of the time for the job and  would highly recommend using again.","448":"The food is great and the prices are reasonable. They give you a nice amount of food for what you pay for.","449":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Surprise, which isn't very hard to do because surprise is full of nasty chain restaurants. However, if you want to eat some darn good vietnamese food, this is the place. The pho of any type is amazing, even to go. Also try the spring rolls. Make sure you wrap them in the lettuce with a bit of mint, the texture is bomb fool! It gets a little crowded around 6pm because all of Sun City eats dinner around that time. So show up around 7pm and you'll be fine.","451":"Great steak. Great service. Cool venue. Although it's died down a bit, this place is still always on my radar for good food.","452":"Oh my gosh.. BOMBBBBBBBB!!! This place is so amazing!! The food is incredible! I have had almost everything on the menu. They have milk shake happy hour every day between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. with half price milkshakes. The first time you go in, tell them its your first time and they will give you a sample of all of their different sauces. My two favorite are sweet heat and creamy garlic. The staff is incredibly friendly and personable. The restaurant is clean and the hand washing station is pretty neat. Go check it out you will not be disappointed!","453":"I have eaten at Pan Asian about 15+ times, and have taken several friends here. \n\nI give it 5 stars because the food is insanely good. How anyone can give the food less than 5 stars is beyond me. I am a food critic and have eaten at hundreds of restaurants. Pan Asian is up there of one of my all time favorites. How anyone can give this place less than 4 stars is beyond me. There are always going to be those negative nellys that only look for what they can complain about. \n\nI give the space and decor 4\/5 stars - it is small and decor is minimal, but it works. \n\nMiso Soup, Massaman Curry, Basil Fried Rice, and a Thai Iced Tea  is my fav at the moment and what I wish I was eating right now...","454":"Had the soup and sandwich.  Wow, it was great.  I can't wait to return.","455":"If you can avoid this company, I recommend you do so. They are in the midst of overcharging me $100 for nothing, and insist I have to prove I don't owe it by going to their inconveniently located offices. They won't take a letter or FAX. Rude on the phone to me.  You have to watch them every month, as we have had other bills that were inaccurate (overbilling us) before, too. NO, I do not recommend.","456":"I've waited 16 years to get this crazy rachet home tattoo covered up I'm celebrating 10!yrs of marriage and had to get this handled. It had scarring it was bad!! Josh came through like a champ his superrrr cool it was a longgg session but I took it like a G and now I'll be in the Domican Republic celebrating without having to worry about my back.\nMy tattoo looks amazing doesn't look like a cover up but most important for who ever is reading this... Your in BOMB professional hands the vibe is comfortable and the people are chill. God bless you and I'll be sending you lots of people Thank you Josh!!!!!!!!!!","458":"Dismal, lukewarm, defrosted-tasting \"TexMex\" glop;\n\nMumbly, unengaged waiter;\n\nClueless manager, who seeing us with barely nibbled entrees\non plates shoved forward for pickup, thanked us\nperfunctorily for our patronage;\n\nWe're from the Texas Hill Country;\ndown there, we jail critters \nwho serve up grub this bad,\nfor their own protection.\n\nNever, never, NEVER again\n(Back to Yard House for real food)","459":"The only thing I found interesting about the place was the self tap tables which I didn't sit at. The service was horrible, my Bloody Mary was disgusting, and the place was a sausage fest ( too many guys). Also I was extremely disappointed by the small dance floor. I knew Dierks Bently was a sellout when they opened their bar in old town Scottsdale. This place is not true to country roots at all.","460":"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before\/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.\n\nI ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.\n\nI also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. \n\nThey brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.\n\nYes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique, delicious restaurant.","461":"Had a groupon decided to check it out, steak was good, server was lacking. It was busy and loud which wasn't bad but it was our first time there, so we weren't familiar withthe menu. Some of us had steak and some had salmon. The salmon came with sides and the steak did not. I wish the server would have told us more about the menu or asked if we wan't sides. The server checked in once and never offered anyone a refill of their drinks.  It felt like they were put out by the groupon and didn't want to deal with us. Prob won't return.","462":"Best fried pickles in town! Great prices, fabulous and friendly staff. Zero complaints.","463":"Last year, I was here on vacation. We had a great experience, which ultimately led us to spending a good amount of money. \n\nI got a gorgeous pendant that I love. Their salesperson told me that my pendant was made of white gold. I'm not quite sure what to believe, but I love the pendant setting and the pearl, of course. \n\nThe problem is that.... when I tried to wear the pendant regularly, I found that my skin would rash wherever the pendant would be resting on. My skin only rashes with low quality metals. My skin doesn't rash with sterling silver or white gold, which this business claims to sell. \n\nI still love my pendant, but I don't know what to do now. I suppose just wear it once in a while for short periods of time... it makes me sad because I really really like the pendant. :(","464":"Great customer service! Lisa and Marie were a big help with deciding what I needed. With so many places to choose from it's great to find a national level business treat you like new neighbors.","465":"First I want to say that our group had an AMAZING time at Encore Beach!!!!!  BUT, we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)\n\nThere was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow \"oversized\" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.\n\nOK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria).","466":"Awesome smoke shop! Can't say any bad things about this place. The son and dad are really nice and provide great customer service. I always come here for my hookah flavor and coal and will continue to do so!","467":"We had a great stay at the Platinum.  I had no qualms at staying at a non-gaming (read: not a casino) hotel off the Strip.  It's a quick walk to all the action (about 5 to 10 minutes to the Flamingo depending on how quick you pound the pavement).  \n\nThe suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.\n\nKinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.\n\nI never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).\n\nThe restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times), but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu, signature cocktails, wines by the glass, bottles that are sold by the glass, and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day, all night. \n\nWe frequented the happy hour several times during our trip, and we were stoked every visit.  \n\nWe plan on making this our home next time we stop in Vegas.  It's the perfect getaway off the Strip.","468":"Amazing Burgers. The combinations of ingredients is Fantabulous  \nIt's difficult to have a favorite and yes, I've had every item on the menu","469":"OK, this buffet is pricey.  Something in the neighborhood of $48 i think, but if you go to the Tix4Tonight or similar vendors you can buy a voucher for $2 that gets you into the buffet for $33 and change, so a total of $35... a $10 savings. A bottle of OK wine is 12 bucks and this becomes a really fun evening. Some complain that the food isn't prepared like some 5 star restaurant, but guess what... This isn't a 5 star restaurant... it's a decent buffet where you can try a little or a lot of everything. It's just fun, and a lot cheaper than those fancy chef name places in the hotels. Oysters,  crab, all kinds of fish and shellfish and lobsters. They have all of this and lots of veges and other dishes. I really like the dessert selection but admittedly,  when I am full of wine, crab, scallops and oysters the deserts start looking less attractive. Food critics, say what you like... the restaurant that fills up nightly for years and years is doing something that real people like! Don't forget to hit the half price ticket place for your discount vouchers before you go!","470":"This place serves consistently good Americanized Middle Eastern food. I've had  tuna and lamb plates here, and they've been good. The flavors won't blow you away but just about everything on the menu is tasty and well prepared. Wait staff has been knowledgeable about the food each time I've been there.  Waterworks location doesn't have a liquor license but there's a state wine store nearby and you can bring a bottle into the restaurant.","471":"Bruh, I'm a stickler for good wings.  Like to the point I can only eat them from about 4 places and I find those places to usually be inferior to the ones I make with my brother.\n\nThis place is a grade A dive and dump.  It is small, old, and needs remodeled,  but the wings are still great!\n\nThey get crispy right.  And, the service was nice too.\n\nThe Buffalo  (seems like a standard combo of whirl and franks) someone is mixed in a way that exceeds other standard buffalo combos.   Also enjoyed the dry cajun.  The sirachi were a bit of a miss though.\n\nAlso, get the fries.  Get a small because they give you so many, but man they are good.\n\nIn short, take it from a wing expert...  the bad reviews are bunk or are based on that customer having bad service.","472":"Despite the decor, the food was amazing.  My dad and I had the fajtas the first night we were in Scottsdale and boy were we surprised.   Our waitress was amazing as she told us a unique way to get to the Grand Canyon, which we didn't regret.  Salsa was amazing and my mom probably ate most of it.  If I ever go back, I hopefully will go back there for some Mexican.  Was there on 2\/15\/2012.","473":"Everything on the menu has a picture so you know what you're getting, the coffee was on point and adorable foam design.","475":"The chips and salsa are so fresh and tasty that I could fill up on just those. They're addictive! We love the Paco's Taco with braised beef and charro beans. They have so many different tequilas & their drink menu is extensive and impressive. Margaritas are unbelievable. Highly recommended.","476":"Don't go here. Especially not for a full hour table massage. I've never tried the chair massages so I can't speak to those, but the table massage was not a great experience. I'll spare the details, but I definitely don't recommend this place.","477":"Great location; convenient to the light rail and apartment complexes.  Sea salt chocolate is my new favorite.  Will be back for other flavors!","478":"Been going here since summer, i am so glad i have discovered this jem! This joint beats any other sushi spot, even though its an izakaya. The menu is extensive. My faves are obviously tsuki don(a must try!) which no other place has, grilled squid that is cooked to perfection which is also rare nowadays, sashimi salad is to die for, and tamaguro roll with red tuna, tomatoes and garlic sauce. I mean everything else that Iv tried here is also delicious. Their lunch boxes are of a great value.The place has great ambience and music, service is always very consistent. This place is good for a quick lunch, big party or nice dinner. Its simply a spot to-go-to! Can't wait to go back!","479":"Love love love Kelly's!   I just discovered this spot while I was doing The Taste of Scottsdale tour.  We stopped there for dessert.  The restaurant gives you the feel of an elegant Irish pub.  They have a pool table, dart board, putting green and HUGE patio!  In the past, I always thought of Kelly's as a bar or late night hang out (which is not really my thing) but I was very wrong!  Their menu looked amazing!  They have an \"award winning\" four cut burger--which I will try next time!  Dessert was delish!  We had the doughnut holes and Kelly's twinkie.  Both were excellent! \n\nI was most impressed with the service!  We were greeted right away.  While we were eating our dessert both a manager and the chef stopped by to check on us.  I was most impressed that the chef and manager cared so much about our experience!  A+ service!  I'm glad I found this new gem in Old Town Scottsdale!  \n\nI can't wait to go back to Kelly's!","480":"Where do I start!? Came here for the first time today and was a little shocked at the prices; we were already sitting down with our two little ones and they were hungry so we weren't going to try and look for another place to eat. We ordered the fried pickles to start with, and wow! I could not believe the size of these things! Shortly after we got our meals, and once again the portions were huge! I finally understood why things were priced the way they were. Everything was sooo good; we will definitely eat here again!","481":"I was in Mesa for the morning and found this gem. I was greeted with a big smile and friendly service. The almond latte was really good, like REALLY good! If I lived in Mesa, I'd be a regular for the friendliness, good coffee, and really nice environment. It was busy, but nice and quiet - a feature that seems a bit rare in my experience. If I need coffee in Mesa again, this will be my go to place.","482":"I've been debating about writing this review.  I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store.  The store inside the mall is very cute.  The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).  At least I know I won't be tempted at the mall anymore.  I guess I should be thankful????","483":"A local favorite, this hole in the wall serves home cooked food that does not disappoint.  I orders two eggs over easy with bacon and rye toast.  The food was cooked to order- hot, tasty and the bacon was thick, crisp and flavorful, just like I hoped it would be. \n\nThe waitstaff is very friendly and took great care of us.  They chatted with everyone who came in and made them feel at home.\n\nOne reminder if you go..... bring cash.  No crest or debit cards taken here!","485":"Very impressed. Jim from Dodge plumbing came out today and presented a very rational and logical argument for why his company should not take my money to convert over to an electric tank-less water heater due to out current logistics and electrical set up and why instead we should forgo this and stick with a gas system to save us money.\nThough they could have gone along with the estimate and soaked us for some money it was nice to get some honest feedback and Jim seems to have a great deal of varied construction experience to give just that.","486":"3.5. Patio is great and spacious. Selection of beer and menu also great. I came here because of the more sophisticated menu variety. I ordered the steak tartare. It's okay, but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here. They use a chicken egg yolk. Tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired. Salmon quinoa bloated. Duck fries were quite good and a large portion too. In terms of fruity beers, I didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste(, but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than I thought. The seating with half booth half stools are a bit weird, apparently my back doesn't like backless chairs. Either way, I would come back if I want beer in a less rowdy bar with an interesting menu for food.","487":"I made a yelp account just so I could write this review, that's how rude the staff is here! The first time I came here I thought maybe it was just a one time thing. But they are consistently, unfailingly, disrespectful. I will never in my life come back here again.","488":"As a resident of Mountains Edge, its obvious we are missing the necessities....Trader Joe's (I'll even settle for a Sprouts), Costco or a NICE big gym...BUT what we do have is this place!!  Barking Dogs is the only place I buy my dog, Phoebe's food and get her groomed. Phoebs is even on a first name basis in this local gem. Staff is very knowledgeable about all things DOGS!!  They love your baby as much as you love them. Its literally less than a mile from my casa.  Yes, my pup and I are lucky and even spoiled with its location.  Be jealous.  Be very jealous. ;)","489":"Pastries are pretty good, but their iced coffee is terrible. Tastes more liked iced tea than iced coffee if I had to make a comparison, but I've had much better iced tea even. Hate to say it, I love local coffee shops, but I can't recommend their coffee. Hope their food is better!","490":"Guarantee you will leave with a full and happy tummy. Not only is the good great, the customer service here is amazing. Can't beat their complementary bean dip and salsa! Food is always fresh and never disappointing. Fajitas are always a good choice and when you order the fresh guac, they'll prepare it at your table! It's like dinner and a show! Will definitely be back whenever I'm in town!","491":"I recently visited Pieology for the first time with friends recently and was really pleased with the selection and taste of the pies. For a set price you can pick your crust, base sauce and toppings, regardless of the amount and variety. The pizzas are made to order and placed in the oven for maybe 5-10 minutes.  There are gluten-free options as well for those that need.  \n\nOverall I'd have to say I'm a fan of Pieology now and will return in the future.  Staff is friendly and efficient. It was a relatively quiet late afternoon so the wait was negligible.  Check it out.","492":"I've eaten at this location twice. The first time I got a falafel to go. I thought the cilantro was a bit much for the falafel, it wasn't what I've been used to in the past. I like a milder basic falafel. Today I had a shawarma pita and it was really good. A little heavy on the red onions so next time I plan to ask for no onions! The price is great for the amount of good you get. My pita's are always loaded up.","493":"Had a good protein omlete. Flavorful food and staff was friendly. I will go back and try some of the other dishes.","494":"Please do not eat at this place, I'm scared of this food. The worst part is the service and the trashy, anti-family, anti-american atmosphere. Please stay away","495":"Troy did my recessed lighting back in January, and he did an AMAZING job. Our home was a struggle, since our ceilings were about 16-17ft high, and he got the job done, fast, easy, and it was beautiful. Great experience.","496":"Delicious oatmeal raisin cookie. Cute little spot and decor. Nice little place to sit and chat over coffee or lunch.","497":"After a spontaneous visit to Piccadilly, I am sold on their artisan organic froyo (with vegan options!) I was skeptical, which is why I held out for so long on a visit...but I was very pleased with the overall experience.\n\nThe decor is trendy and interesting, it's Cleveland-centric, and they offer great vegan options. When our group entered the store, we were warmly welcomed and given an explanation of how everything worked. It's a per-ounce froyo place with lots of possibilities. I chose the artisan organic tart yogurt and the vegan blueberry...mmm. One thing to note is that because it's vegan (made with coconut milk), it's not as creamy and melts a bit quicker if you're not used to vegan things. Yum. \n\nThey have lots of topping options, along with organic MOCHI and tons of fruit. They also have nutella and flavored bubbles! I usually go with the mochi and fruit with froyo, and all of it was very fresh.\n\nIt turned out to be a bit pricy, but I'm willing to pay for it - the whole thing, from the froyo to the overall experience.","498":"This place is the best. My friends and I get takeout from here all the time, and it's great because I can exercise my total indecision right up to choosing food, because they have sooooooo many choices. Thai? Vietnamese? Chinese? Sushi? Tottie's has it all, and it is ALL delicious. Sugar Cane Chicken? Pho? Pad Thai? What are you in the mood for!? The prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are decent, not overwhelming, but everything is flavorful and distinctive.","499":"way overrated, owner and manager have a seriously lousy attitude. Overpriced for sure. Bumpers is the place to go for the crab legs, not mushy like Pickle Bills. They have the river right outside the place so they feel they can justify the increased pricing.","500":"Food was pretty good however the prices are high. Waitress did a great job until she asked if I needed change.","501":"I booked a session and decided to also use my coupon for free Easter collage. The girl told me it would take 45 min to print. Showed up 45min later and I guess they were having issues formatting it to print out correctly. Hour and a half total spent waiting and the guy kept saying if you wait I'll give a free print. I had already waited hour and a half along with session time and a five month old wasn't going to deal with it much longer. I don't travel to chandler often and live 30min from this location. I told them they needed to mail it to me and I left furious. Never again!\n\nUpdate: The area manager did contact me and had my missing photos mailed and also had one of them framed for me.","502":"Holy \"Made fresh at your table\" Guacamole!!!  My heart skips a beat just thinking about it.  Tex-Mex fine dining... at it's finest.\nAlso an important note:  One of my top five places to drink a house margarita.","503":"As a long-time fan of Chick-fil-A, I wasn't walking in expecting to be comparing the two. But as we ordered, sat down, and were served, I couldn't help it. The service is as good, if not better here than at CFA. The sauces are better, and so is the chicken! Everything was very clean and we were thoroughly impressed. I would like more sandwich options--I think next time I'll just be getting chicken strips because I ended up eating just the chicken off my pimento crunch sandwich. Very impressed!!!","504":"Came here on a whim to try it out with my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e and we were not impressed at all. Ordered the street corn queso and it was super lacking on flavor and also pulled a large chunk of butter from it. Tried to save it a little with the sauce tray and even added salsa to it and still wasn't there. My Sonoran dog looked like it was from the previous day... typical dry wrinkled no snap day-old dog, the brioche bun was soggy from too much butter. And the tacos were cold. We Couldn't even finish the meal. The salsa was the only highlight of the lunch. Also watched a server shatter a glass over the ice well and proceed to use the ice that the glass had broken into to serve a customer. I will NEVER return.","505":"Very disappointing, the price is too expensive for the food quality.   First of all, there is no green tea or red bean  ice cream on the menu.   They only have ice cream bar, and it is only one per person, on the menu, they didn't say that is limited. Secondly, way too much rice on the sushi. I guess thats how they make the money. Lastly, the ipad service is stupid. you have to wait for someone to confirm it. Overall, not a good reataurant for sushi.","507":"Great food. Try the chop its huge.friendly service and down home atmosphere.","508":"There was hair in our food and drinks - multiple times!  We had to send out food and drinks back 3 different times. \n\nWe were about 10 deep in out party.  2 booths seated directly next to each other. One table ordered chicken tacos.  The minute the server sat the plate down we noticed there was hair in it.  She took it right back.  \nOne of our Margaritas came out immediately after .. there was a long strain of hair floating on top.  The server took it right away and apologized - again.  The other table ordered nachos .. and guess what ... hair was it ... stuck in the Queso.  This time the server stood there and waited until we looked over the nachos.  We both noticed the hair.  He said WOW!  You guys see it's not my hair (he had a short brown cut with a cap on).   He again, returned the nachos and we decided not to order anything else.  \n\nI'll never return!","509":"They worry about their therapist but not their customers. I've been going on here for awhile and one time I missed and forgot about my appointment they charged me $60. They said that's the least they charge. Normally it's full price of your service. If it was so important not to miss an appointment why don't they give an automated text reminder within 1-2 hours of appointment like other places???","510":"Great place for a smaller breakfast, and pretty great coffee as well.","511":"So idk why ppl are giving this place such a hard time. I'm reviewing for EDC weekend. We checked in Thursday (the 20th). The guy up front gave me great service. \nIf you're looking for a place just to crash it's not bad. Nice location. Mid strip. Kinda hidden though. It was a bit hard to get ppl to find us haha.\nDon't expect a hot tub or something fancy. Like I said, just a place to crash.","512":"The most important thing for a restaurant is food safety and clean. See what I got from my dish. Other bugs maybe still forgivable. But cockroach means this restaurant is really dirty nasty and not take their kitchen clean job seriously.","513":"My wife and I participated in the MS Walk and decided it was the perfect opportunity to give the famous River Cafe a try.  What a beautiful spot and a great ambience.  We were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full.  We got a great spot by the window that opened, so a great compromise.\nThe experience.  The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good.\nThe flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible.\nOverall I am glad we went because we had been wondering about this place but I would be very hesitant to go back.","515":"Best barbecue this side of the Mississippi!!!! Come here your car washed and detailed pick up some Petroleum, and slap your lips around the best barbecue you've had in Arizona!!! Hot diggity !!!","516":"Great and fresh food (had filet mignon and asparagus), quick and friendly service, and warm atmosphere are the reasons for my 5 star rating.  They were very busy for 9pm on a Tuesday night so the locals love it.  The bar area is good for dining too.  TV's with Baseball playoffs were good for entertainment.","517":"This is my very first bike! JT was very helpful along with his staff! Very friendly and they really take their time to help you and find what you need! I was there for a really long time but i never got the feeling that i was an annoyance. They really take go out of their way to make sure you get all the answers to make an informed decision. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend coming here!","519":"To whomever owns Lucki Thai:   Lucki is actually spelled with a y.   Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.\n\nI've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.\n\nI've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.  \n\nOf the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.   \n\nThe only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.\n\nI have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?\n\nBut alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist.","520":"Do not use. Should be call Unreliable towing service. Never showed up. Kept saying they were minutes away","522":"Yum! I could eat it every day. My favorite is the \"special\" burro.  My second would have to be the two tacos. Beef or chicken, both delicious. Affordable, quick, and take some tortillas home for later.","524":"This is one of the best \"hole in the wall\" spots I've been to in years! Fresh home-made tortillas, great steak, people are amazing! I came with a party of 10 ppl and the food was fast, delicious and prefer was perfect. I will definitely be back!","525":"Their specialty dishes are very unique.  The spicy tuna nachos are amazing. Some of my favorites are: lemon roll and the edamame is a must.  For desert also try the chocolate chip cookie with fudge and vanilla ice cream - yummy\nWe celebrated a birthday in the Tatami room.  Beautiful private room, we sat on cushions  in a very cozy setting.","526":"Wow! What a great sub. All of them are fantastic.I especially like the rosemary bun. The staff are alway great too and  have a up beat and positive attitude. Perfect for a quick lunch.","527":"I was sent to Vision Source South Hills for a second opinion. I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient\/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: \"patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance\". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service. While I feel Dr. Strain is a highly qualified ophthalmologist, I am exceedingly disappointed in the professionalism and efficiency of the office staff. At this point, I do not see myself returning in the future.","528":"I've had their \"Cleveland's\" breakfast many times and it is perfect every time. The best eggs and sausage breakfast in town. I don't know how they do it, but their scrambled eggs are the best I've ever had. I've tried to duplicate it at home without success. I get the same thing every time I go. Scrambled eggs with sausage, potatoes and toast with a side of Guinness. Yum!","529":"Great Parathas. A little pricey. The service could be better. But, going into an Indian fast-food place, I had a very low expectation. The place wasn't so clean, but oh well. The food made up for it. We went back three times during our 6 days trip to Vegas.","530":"Alway stop when we're in town. Amazing fresh food. Really good prices. Friendly  service.  Drink menu has a good variety as well.","531":"I'm from LA and been looking for an awesome cut here in Vegas. I got that here from Favio. He took his time and gave me EXACTLY what I wanted. I'll definitely be back!","532":"It's awesome here!!The guys are soooo hot and nice!!The host London is amazing at the mic and getting the crowd excited!!highly recommend this place!!","533":"We've always been customers of Petco. We like the layout and the products they carry. Of course you can find some of the products cheaper elsewhere but we're fans of \"one-stop-shop\". One of our dogs comes here for his monthly wash and brushout, they ladies are great with him. They also have a woman who is \"certified\" for cats, didn't know you needed to be certified but I guess it's a good idea. Friendly staff and a great dog trainer too!","534":"We dropped by in hopes of finding Atkinson's Peanut Butter Bars(we first tried them From Honey Salt's candy bowl ) and after searching a few minutes, we found it. \n\nI was also bummed that stores didn't carry Peanut Butter Twix anymore, but now I'm happy that they can also be found at Rocket Fizz.. On our way out, wifey grabbed an RC Cola and I tried a Key Lime Pie soda which was pretty good.\n\nIf you're searching for a candy or soda pop you grew up with and can no longer find, there's a good chance you'll find it here. If only Now and Later would bring back their bubble gum flavored taffy, and If Tidal Wave Gum came back to life...The Green Apple was my favorite!......ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(3\/100) \"  Our Retro Return\"","535":"Two thumbs up!!!!\n\nPho (soup) and their Banh Minhs (sandwiches) are to die for!!! Not to mention their Chinese Food choices!!!! This place is a hole in the wall but their food choices are awesome!!!\n\nLocated 5 miles from the airport, no traffic, parking is not a problem either!!!!\n\nThe staff are courteous and gets your order right!!!","536":"Fresher noodles you may not find in this town, I tried the steamed vegetable dumplings and the chicken noodle soup - loved it! But careful the portions are big but the staff box it nicely and it still that's great next day :)\nAlso the mango bubble tea was tasty.","537":"The draft beer selection is great the tapas style menu is a perfect match and the upstairs is a great after work gathering place. But the best thing about this place is the bartender named Siti (sp) he is one of the best in Charlotte.","538":"Excellent ramen and one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. Very small area and limited seating, so arrive early or be ready to wait. Recommend all the bowls, sake flights, and be sure to get green tea ice cream.","539":"Had an awesome breakfast cum brunch. \nStaff is very warm and courteous and delicious food","540":"Went to see the exhibit \"killer heels\" and was greatly surprised. The shoes that were there were breathtaking for a real show lover like me. Everything from classic Pravda to crazy lady gaga shoes. It was a great girls day on a hot day. :)","541":"Fresh and quality sashimi and great lunch time prices.  I tried it for lunch once and I am a fan, there are few quality Japanese restaurants in the city but this is amazing (even though it's Korean owned) and great value for the money.  Great decor and swift service.","542":"Great ambience and decor! And the food is delicious. Pan fried fish, street side Indian noodles, hongkong chicken are a few names to start with !","544":"After living in Tempe for several months and not finding a nail salon, I went on yelp :) and found Nancy's. The reviews looked pretty good so I decided to give it a try. Like some of the other reviews mentioned, the salon doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside everything is great. The facility is clean, but what makes the difference for me is the fact that the staff there was so friendly, and welcoming. All of the technicians were talking with the clients and there were even a few friendly group conversations between everyone in the salon. It was very comfortable! Most of the ladies in there during my appointment were regular clients and they had nothing but good things to say about the place after learning that it was my first time there. Loyal clientele is always a good sign. \nJohnny did my acrylic nails (full set) which I am totally in love with. He did a great job and was also really personable. \nanother awesome thing about this salon is that they offer a 5% discount to anyone that pays in cash! 5% isn't a lot, but it's still a pretty cool little perk. I will definitely be returning.","545":"One of my favorite breakfast place to go to with my high school son. He loves the food. We both love a good breakfast joint.","546":"We went here for the 1st time this evening and really enjoyed it - great ambiance, delicious food with amazing flavors, and good service. We really liked the fresh roll, spring rolls, dumplings, wild curry (good spice!), and basil chicken. They served healthy portions. Cash only & BYOB. We will definitely return!","547":"My husband and I ordered our wedding cake here. We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12\" x 12\" square and 10-12\" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8\" square base, next layer 6\" base and the top layer 4\" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4\" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1\/2\" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on.","548":"I went to Itech Customs for just a quick quote on my iphone6s screen\/ front camera crack. iTech fixed it all for $75 when Sprint was going to charge me over $150. Thank you & I will definitely be back for any issues that I have with phone repair! I'm extremely happy and impressed! I'm recommending iTech Customs to all of my friend!!","549":"We chose this place to split lunch and it was an excellent choice. Waiter was very enthusiast and funny. Had a good beer selection (mostly bottles) which was refreshing after much walking. BLT fried green tomato appetizer is a must have. We split the blue plate for our meal. Watermelon was tasty, chicken as well. Chicken wasn't anything special for me, but I am by no means a fried chicken expert. Only downfall was restaurant was a bit dark for lunch.","550":"Enjoyed Nee House immensely. No service issues, just fantastic chinese food. Food order? Spicy Green Beans = Perfect!, Chow Fun (Chicken) = Perfect! \n\nJust a great place. Perhaps my expectations were set by all the bad service reviews, but I was not disappointed.","551":"In town for a convention and looking for something away from the strip. Found this place on Yelp and was not disappointed. Mango margaritas were tasty as were the shrimp tacos. The waiter mistakenly brought me the fish tacos (which were actually quite good as well) and was very apologetic when I pointed this out. He then replaced them as quickly as possible.","553":"Got a chance to check out this spot while catching up with a business contact for coffee.  The gentleman working this morning was patient in explaining their offerings .  The coffee was smooth and only needed a bit of almond milk - kudos to the cafe for having that as an available option.  \n\nI had the pleasure of enjoying the croissant, it had the right amount of flakiness and was bigger than expected.  The atmosphere was casual and laid back.  I now look forward to trying this place out later in the day.","554":"We just used Honest Air for the second time this year because they most certainly live up to their name. The first time was in the heat of the summer when water started dripping from the ceiling. Our home warranty said it would be four days (it was a Saturday, my husband was out of town and my elderly parents were staying with me) before anyone could be out to service our home so I immediately looked up local companies myself and called Honest Air at 3:30PM on a Saturday and had someone out to my house by 4PM. The gentleman that showed up was instantly able to locate the problem and solution - terrible install design by the home builders - and my dad actually was able to make the repair with the technician's directions. The service charge was more than reasonable and I was just relieved to be able to continue using the AC. We just called them out again today to check our system as the vents do not blow equally throughout the house resulting in hot spots and cool spots. The very same technician came out and looked at our system again - and again all of our issues are due to how cheaply made the house was back in 1999 - and spent about 20 minutes teaching us how to have better air flow and utilize the vents in the house wisely. He was very kind, respectful, and clean. Whenever we need our AC or furnace repaired, replaced, or even just checked up on we will always be using Honest Air.","555":"Gorgeous hotel! I felt like a VIP. Definitely the next best thing to the real Venice, in my opinion. Lots of pools to choose from and great casino. Convenient location- close to everything. Would definitely go there again.","556":"Yes! As good as it gets in way of pinball machines! My parents and I had so much fun crossing this one off the bucket list. Plus we each got to take a walk down memory lane looking at all the machines. We loved how each machine told the history, year, etc. Keep up the good work pinballers!"}}
