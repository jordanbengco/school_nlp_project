Over $8Gs. These crooks actually had the nerve to charge us $69 for 3 pills. I checked online the pills can be had for 19 cents EACH! Avoid Hospital ERs at all costs.","1":"I *adore* Travis at the Hard Rock's new Kelly Cardenas Salon!  I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \n\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \n\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \n\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!","2":"I have to say that this office really has it together, they are so organized and friendly!  Dr. J. Phillipp is a great dentist, very friendly and professional.  The dental assistants that helped in my procedure were amazing, Jewel and Bailey helped me to feel comfortable!  I don't have dental insurance, but they have this insurance through their office you can purchase for $80 something a year and this gave me 25% off all of my dental work, plus they helped me get signed up for care credit which I knew nothing about before this visit!  I highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has!","3":"Went in for a lunch. Steak sandwich was delicious, and the Caesar salad had an absolutely delicious dressing, with a perfect amount of dressing, and distributed perfectly across each leaf. I know I'm going on about the salad ... But it was perfect.\n\nDrink prices were pretty good.\n\nThe Server, Dawn, was friendly and accommodating. Very happy with her.\n\nIn summation, a great pub experience. Would go again!","4":"Today was my second out of three sessions I had paid for. Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn't even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn't stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won't be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman's behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" Admit your wrongs, but don't make your guest feel unwelcome because you can't do you job properly.","7":"This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality\n\nMany of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.\n\nThe service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.\n\nIt's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options.","11":"Walked in around 4 on a Friday afternoon, we sat at a table just off the bar and walked out after 5 min or so. Don't even think they realized we walked in. However everyone at the bar noticed we walked in!!! Service was non existent at best. Not a good way for a new business to start out. Oh well, the location they are at has been about 5 different things over the past several years, so they will just be added to the list. SMDH!!!","14":"I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.  I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).  Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.  After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.  I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.  The worst part of it was that the service.  The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).  We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.  They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out.","15":"You can't really find anything wrong with this place, the pastas and pizzas are both amazing and high quality, the price is very reasonable, the owner and the staff are very friendly, if you're in downtown check this place out, a lot of people think just because it's downtown there are lots of options around but that's not always the case as there is also a lot of poor quality food in downtown as well.","18":"We've been a huge Slim's fan since they opened one up in Texas about two years ago when we used to live there. This place never disappoints. They even have great salads and grilled chicken. Plus they have fresh brewed sweet tea, it's the best!","20":"Our family LOVES the food here. Quick, friendly, delicious, and a great restaurant to take kids to. 5 stars!","21":"If you are looking for the best pierogies in Pittsburgh, this is your place. There are a few small tables outside but most of the business is carry out. Pierogies Plus wins Best Pierogies every year. Why? Because the owner is from Poland and she is making the real deal pierogies. The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women. \nThe biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors. They are like plump pillows of softness. You can buy them buy the dozen. You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat. The warm ones are served with butter and onions.  It's definitely a comfort food. The best part is that they ship internationally. Yes, they are that good.","23":"Pick any meat on the planet and the chef will make a Mexican style dish with amazing flavor! Wow, fish and lamb tacos to die for. Drinks are great as well.","24":"Great food, great service. Obviously fried chicken isn't the healthiest food on earth, but once a month I get that craving for good fried chicken. Their chicken is great, doesn't seem too fatty, and their sides are excellent too. A+","25":"PlumbSmart provided superior service from beginning to end.  They were able to repair a badly damaged sewer pipe with only one day's notice.  I was particularly pleased with their attention to care when cleaning up the landscape after the job was completed.  Their competitive pricing and excellent service make them my first stop for all future plumbing needs.  Thank you to Wayne and the whole team!\n\n-Scott B","26":"Unfortunately, I must recommend not to conduct any business with Fast Fix Jewelry and Watch Repairs.  The staff is completely unprofessional and I have never been treated so rudely in my life.  I was actually shocked and walked away thinking \"wow, how do those people even have a job?\"\n\nI have never written a negative review before, I usually chalk it up to someone having a bad day.  I have worked in customer service for 10+ years and I know it is exhausting and bad days happen.  But this is a special occasion.\n\nI drove 30 minutes to try to find someone who could help me repair a watch band.  I was barely greeted upon arrival and right away felt like I was bothering them.  The girl behind the counter obviously just wanted me to leave, the blond kid working snapped at me when I asked a question and when I re-asked in order to clarify what he said he snapped again and said, \"I already told you?!?\"  \"Is this even authentic?\"  Shouting at me over his shoulder as he work on something else. \n\nI was shocked and just stood there put my watch away awkwardly and left with no one else saying a word to me.  There are a lot of places that fix Jewelry in this city and I will be taking my business elsewhere and recommend that people reading this review do the same.  Some places, just do not deserve a loyal customer base.","27":"their pettuccine was fresh-made in the morning. it was very delicate and yummy! the owner and staffs are super kind and delightful. We also had Veal piccata. it was classic! love this restaurant.","28":"if i can give this place no stars i would, i only had their hot pot though, so im not a good judge for anything besides their shabu. i must say, quantity was small, price is expensive for the quality and quantity, and the taste of the soup base is bland as if they just put hot water in. the sauce selection is limited and not very fresh\/clean from my perspective. i love hot pot and i would never go back again because home made hot pot can be much better than this place without even trying. anyways, if you have a good appetite for hot pot, you can do yourself a favor and skip this place because it can make you miserable!","29":"This review is in regards to our experience watching SuperBowl 51 February 5, 2017 at the WestGate in the theater\/auditorium.\n\nWatch the game somewhere else.....\n\nTo those unfamiliar with The Big Game experience at WestGate you typically would get in line to watch the Superbowl in the theater portion of the hotel around 8 am on Superbowl Sunday. This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.\n\nSo at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....\n\nWe were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow.\nThat's right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.\n\nSo we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.\n\nIn summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else. We will.","30":"ended up here because Raku was closed and it received great ratings on Yelp.  I'm so glad I came here.  One of the better meals I've had.  Started off with the mushroom dish and the lettuce wrap.  both were amazing. the lettuce wrap is like having a flavor party in your mouth.  also had the panang duck which was terrific. highly recommend all three dishes. one dish that wasn't so good was the seabass with drunken noodles. overall it was an excellent meal, intimate setting, and great service. definitely will be back.","31":"I tried this place because my girls are away for a month, and I REALLY wanted to try to wait until they came back, because NOBODY can hold a candle to them, but my toes were desperate.  When I went in, they were almost twice what I usually pay to begin with.  Then, before starting the pedicure, I specifically told them I already had gel polish on my toes.  They didn't tell me right then and there \"that will be an extra $5'.  No, they waited until it was time to pay, and not only charged me for that, but they charged me all kinds of extra fees that I didn't even ask for!  I had also informed the girl that my toenail was loose and needed gluing.  While I was looking at my phone, all of a sudden I felt this sensation, and she RIPPED OFF MY TOENAIL!!!!  Without even asking me!!!!!!  So then she had another girl come and put acrylic on there since the nail underneath was only 1\/2 grown.  Again, they didn't tell me how much this would be, or even ask my permission, they just charged me at the end.  \n\nThe added stone 'massage' was barely a massage!  She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I'm used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn't even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that! \n\nUgh, I don't care HOW ugly my toes look next time, I will NEVER go anywhere else besides Bella Nails again, they ROCK!!!!!!!  This place was appalling.  I didn't want to make a scene, so I just paid the money, but I will NEVER go back!!!!!!!","32":"Love this place downtown but the Scottsdale location has no manners. Sat at bar for 10 min while bartender ignored us. No menu, no water. We walked out and they could have cared less.","33":"Best chinese resto. Highly recommended. 5 stars. Let us support this business. Best in the west valley. Trust me you wont gi wrong coming to this place","34":"Came here on a Thursday night at 6:30 p.m. My friends and I had a reservation, but it was not needed - the place was almost empty.\n\nSERVICE: Extremely Poor\n\nWhile I enjoyed the company of my friends, I would not come back to this restaurant, primarily because of the poor service. Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders. \n\nMAIN: Caprese Salad\n\nThe salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).\n\nMAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it) \n\nThese fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you visit this restaurant, I would recommend this particular dish, especially given the price ($8) and the portion size (it was quite large - almost the size of a large plate).","36":"This place epitomizes the rumored transformation that is in the process of taking place in Pittsburgh. Great food, drinks, and service, but the atmosphere is second to none. Definitely a must visit for locals and visitors alike! You will not feel like you're in \"Pittsburgh\".","38":"They keep there appointments on time and are pretty efficient. However I am very disappointed in how they think that just because I am a girl that I do not know what is going on with my car's tires. The guy that helped me out told me that my two front tires tread was extremely low and that I would be needing two new tires in a month or two. He told me that he could show me the same tires I have on there now and how much they would be. When the I had taken my car to the other Discount Tire they told me it that my tread was actually still really good for how many miles I have on my car. When he told me the price of the two tires it was around $280. Which I had just bought two new ones a couple months before that and they were the same price. So when I bought the two new tires my tire pressure light came on not that long after that. I honestly feel like the tires were not even new and did not look worth $280.","39":"Met a friend for dinner there tonight. The server only brought us one menu. After she brought us a couple of Cokes she didn't come to our table for 20 mins. After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food, so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes. The most we actually saw our server was when she hovered over us as we put the tip into the handheld credit card terminal. \n\nFood was somewhere between okay and decent. Service was somewhere between piss poor and terrible.","42":"I called the number provided and same day they showed up to my residence for an inspection. Was able to advise me of multiple broken and loose tiles on my roof and came out just a few days later and completed the repairs. Quoted me a good price for the repairs as well. No complaints!","43":"Party of 3 ordered the fish tacos, pork belly banh mi, corn beef hash Benedict, and bam ham. Everything was delicious, esp the pork belly banh mi. It's tender and juicy and the baguette was nicely toasted. Love the crispy fish taco too. Their compliment chips and salsa were fresh and super good and crispy. Service was excellent. Our waitress did a great job checking up on us and serving us. I really want other food options too but I'm too full. Next time i visit i will definitely come back.","44":"We had dinner at the Bellagio Buffet last night. The service was OK. Our server was great but kind of forgot about us towards the end of our visit. The food was cold. The only good thing there was the crab legs because they're suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made. The food was under a single lamp that didn't heat the food at all. We let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge. All she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief. Have no idea what actually happened though because we didn't see her after that. Half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn't that many options. I must say i rather go to the Rio buffet. For a high end casino this was a horrible experience.","45":"I really enjoyed my visit here.\nEverything was visually appealing to me.\nAmbiance was great. Food tasted amazing. Service was . No complaints at all","46":"Flat out fantastic!  Have been here twice and the croissants are the bomb. Can't wait until I can try other items. THE new breakfast spot in Ahwahtukee. The service is great as well. Family run business. Come and support them.","49":"I am years out from surgery with sacs and I wish I could turn back time.  He promises great things them butchers your body. I should have left my body alone. It was not bAd. I was out to perfect it.  We often talk about how he ruined a good body.  I will never forget his dirty nasty slippers coming into the operating room. I should have run from the room then.","50":"Such a unique place & a great find. Our waitress was funny, knowledgable, and did a fantastic job. The food was amazing. We will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to other couples!","51":"Best Wonton soup ever!!! Delicious food and great service. We had Chicken Satay, Roti C., Wonton soup, and one of the fried noodle and shrimp dishes. Definitely will be back!","52":"I've never experienced discrimination as I did last night at this place. I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn't because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be \"picky\" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.","54":"Absolutely love this place! I've been here many times and it never fails to impress me  the bff burger is unreal and the tsoynamis and cupcakes are amazing!! Everything is pretty much the best","58":"There is a reason I frequent Paul's Ace over the big names such as Home Depot or Lowes: the personalized assistance. Do the big name brands provide this? Yes, bit not at the same level Paul's Ace Hardware does in Tempe. If I need help, they are ready and willing to help me in every aspect of my project.\n\nThe store manager Bras personally went out if his way to assist me in gathering all the materials I needed for my current project. He knows his store, bounced around to show me all options, and seemed to have recommendations on each project. This guy must love what he does because he knows everything in the store (or he is a constant do-it-yourselfer).\n\nI am always pleased with the help I receive and am thankful this place is in my neighborhood.","61":"Easily entering my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte after just one visit!\n\nPork Belly, unreal! Had an AMAZING prime NY Strip with bourbon butter jam, PHENOMENAL!","65":"((( LADIES BEWARE))) Don't ever take your machine to 35th Ave. sew and vac on Northern they broke my Elna machine while it was being repaired. I've spent over $10.000 at their store over the years and have been a long time customer .. Bill the owners son was so rude to me and did nothing to resolve my broken machine. I was disgusted when Bill the owners daughter wouldn't do Any thing to help me when the repair man broke my machine. It's terrible to bring a nice sewing machine in to be repaired and these people broke it while in their possession and they don't want to do a damm thing about it. It was like a big (screw you) to me. I won't buy another thing from these people for the way I was treated. Even the material is too over priced. I'm in the market for another machine but I won't go there ever again. My machine STILL NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT RESOLVED THIS ISSUE. ITS STILL BROKEN AND IT HAPPENED WHILE REPAIRMAN WAS SERVICING MY MACHINE. I WISH I HAD NEVER TAKEN MY MACHINE TO 35TH AVE SEW AND VAC SHOP. WHY CANT PEOPLE OWN UP TO TAKE OWNERSHIP TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN MISTAKES!!!! GO TO KINGS SEWING MACHINES MUCH BETTER SERVICE AND THEY DONT BREAK YOUR MACHINE!!!!!","66":"Great tanning salon near me, and clean, equipped with the latest tech and easy checkin and out spot for a short yet amazing relaxation and sunbathing time in chilli Cleveland. I am going to be obsessed with this place in winters and will recharge myself with vitamin D!","67":"Th service here is very hit or miss... Sometimes the staff is personable and attentive. Other times I ask myself, \"Why do I come here???\" The staff often has the  \"GTFOH\" stamp placed permanently across their foreheads, and we as patrons just have to go with it, otherwise we are deemed \"that guy.\"  I would say that my continuos visits were for the great HH, but there are several other options close to home, with the same food and drink options for me to choose from. I think today may be last visit...","69":"I took my wife out for a Birthday dinner with my daughter on 12-16-14  at Alfonsos.  I heard the food was good and it was and my waitress ( Dawn ) was also good ( even with it being very busy ). The problem I have is some of the waitress staff are rude. I had a gift card\/ certificate to pay for dinner. After a few minutes, a big blond waitress came over and said  ( in a loud and rude tone ) I couldn't use it cause I needed to spend $100.00 in order to get $50.00 off. She then insulted me by saying (so the tables around me could hear ) couldn't I read the fine print telling me of requirements to use gift card. I showed her the certificate and the fine print was not legible She told me, sorry that's not our fault it's yours and she walked away. I am having second thoughts about going back to use gift card. I may give it away or toss it out.","70":"This company tried deliver flowers to our home- my son was home by himself and called me.  I had him keep me on the phone while he opened the front door (our security screen door was  locked though).  He told the gal that he was not going to open the door, that his mom (me) was on the phone and he asked the driver to call me, his mom.  The driver was very insistent about getting a signature and became argumentative.  My son kept saying, call my mom, she's on the phone now.  And she kept interrupting and insistent on a signature.  I told my son to close the door.  I then called the company and spoke with a Manager, Sara.  She understood my concern and said she would make sure the driver was trained on these situations.  Three days pass and I still don't have my flowers or a phone call.  I called and spoke with Sara and she had a completely different tone with me than previously.  She was very curt and tried to give me lots of excuses. I asked that the Owners call me.  Five days later, I've never received a call back from the Owner or my flowers.  I called to find out when one of the Owners would call back, and Linda told me it would be by Friday, which meant six days later than my initial request.  I told Linda that was pretty unreasonable and she told me that the Owners are busy and have several other businesses.  In my opinion, that's completely unacceptable- do yourself a favor and do not order from this Company.  They are very unprofessional and not very concerned about customer service.","74":"My company hosted a dinner and awards night at the hotel last night and the experience was the best we could have imagined! Working with Kristine Cole was fantastic and the communication was always on point. I walked in to be blown away by the set up and I had compliments on the food all night. I came into work today to be flooded with emails on how impressed everyone was with the presentation. The staff that was there to help us was GREAT! I believe Tim was in charge and he had Anna and one other gentleman with him and they made us laugh and gave us the privacy we needed. We will be back and I will be recommending them to everyone!","75":"Yes... the Boba Tea explosion is in full force. I have been to Lee Lee International Supermarket in Chandler many times, but I never noticed this little gem next to it until a couple years ago. Boba Tea House has serving up some of the best boba tea in the Valley long before it became a big thing. They have a fantastic array of flavors and drink choices to choose like fruit slushes, snow, milk tea, pudding, mango jelly, coffee jelly, etc. They even have snacks like popcorn chicken, fried tofu, and fries. The staff is super friendly and the prices are reasonable. I still laugh at my friends who have no idea what Boba Tea is or are too afraid to suck up one of those chewy ball things. LOL. In case you didn't know, Boba Tea is a flavored tea (usually with milk) to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. I think they are super delicious. Today I got the Blueberry Milk Boba Tea and it made for the perfect snack in the middle of my day. Another favorite of my mine is the honeydew milk tea.","76":"Yum!! Had the kale grits and would definitely have those again! Menu choices are unique, farm fresh and delicious!","79":"Dreadful Service\n\nI've had Jimmy John's before several years ago in Minneapolis.. But apparently here in Phoenix, the store personnel must be trained differently. I had to take my sandwich back up to the counter twice to get the thick headed folks working at the one on Camelback at about 16th to get my sandwich the way I wanted it.\n\nI asked for a #10 Hunter's Club with all the veggies. What I got was the standard #10 Hunters Club with lettuce and tomatoes. \n\nAfter seeing that, I took it back up to the counter, and explained that I wanted all the veggies. They explained to me that those were all the veggies the sandwich came with. I carefully explained that I wanted all of the veggies that they have. The guy said, oh, you want the Freebies. I would have thought he would have clarified when I ordered whether I just wanted everything that came on the sandwich, or the Freebies as well. I said yes, I wanted all of the Freebie Veggies. \n\nI took my revised sandwich and sat down to eat it, only to find that along with the veggies I had requested, they had piled on Italian vinaigrette and Dijon mustard, which I did NOT want.","80":"These burgers are phenomenal! The Galley Boy just melts in your mouth, and paired with the potato teasers and a milkshake it is like heaven on Earth.","83":"First off food is DELICIOUS! By far my favorite restaurant in downtown Phoenix. I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints, but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second, the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter, will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor! He constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much). He made the experience at the Arrogant Butcher memorable!","84":"At least the Pinks concession stand by Section 3.  Unqualified servers who don't tell you that they won't take cash - and they seriously won't take cash.  Then the manager wouldn't even take the cash to another register. The lines are stupid \nlong and the workers incapable of handling the slightest issue. I m sitting upstairs if there is a next time I come to a Knights game.","86":"I was told so many great things about this place but my entire experience was awful. The food wasn't very good, way too greasy. My fries were luke warm and my tray was literally covered in grease. I needed about 50 napkins and a shower after that. The service was pretty awful too. I can't believe I paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings. On national cheeseburger day of all days too. Such a disappointment and I've never gone back since. Best thing about it was the soda, but that's pretty difficult to mess up.","87":"Came here for the \"midnight\" launch of the PSVR. After previously being told by another employee a week prior to get there at 6:01PM to get one of the six extra systems that weren't pre-ordered, and that it was first come first serve, I ended up not able to get a system. When I came in yesterday, the woman behind the counter told me they had written down names and numbers of people who wanted one a few days prior, and that they all were accounted for. \n\nThe previous employee even told me I was the first person to have asked about it. If they were organized, and told ALL their employees customers could put their names down on a PSVR, I could have gotten a system last night.\n\nNot only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at GameStop, but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away, and lines were already forming at each location). \n\nNot happy.","88":"This place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. \n\nMy favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello, the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka, Lasagna, or Ravioli.\n\nMario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks. \n\nPlus to top it off, when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues, Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons. \n\nGet the idea? It's all good at this neighborhood gem!","89":"Dr.K. & Dr.B. together with their Agape team are caring, professional, thorough and knowledgeable.\nDr.K. & Dr.B. will holistically bring your health & well being back into balance, not just treat individual injuries.\nEach visit is carefully tailored to your current state of being and needs.","90":"Man, I love Toronto! Hiding in a strip mall on Overlea, find a dingy looking restaurant that serves up fantastic, cheap kabob...be warned regardless of when you come here you'll likely be waiting for a table as this place is always overrun with people...If you're a fan of perfectly grilled spicy meat, you must try this place out...now that I've been here I need to limit how many times I go here per month :)\n\nTake the drive out and have some kabob...if you don't own a car, borrow one or get a zipcar membership...totally worth it!","91":"Today was my first time seeing the staff at Bella Smile and it was a great experience.  Although I'm not currently living in Las Vegas I plan on coming back for checkups and any other problems that may arise.  There was no wait time whatsoever and I was out of there without a drop of pain or discomfort.  The manager Severn was very accommodating and will be getting business from my family and friends in town.","93":"One of the crappier Marriotts I've ever stayed at. The staff is nice and professional enough. But the fact that it's right by the frontage road along I-17, you tend to attract a seedier crowd. Also, with three floors worth of rooms here, guess how many washer\/dryer they have for everyone? ONE crappy washer and ONE crappy dryer! Don't even think about washing your clothes on a Friday night. For a two hour period, I went to see if the washer was finally available, each time I was met with yet another load of dirty clothes inside. If they can't afford to get more machines, consider installing one of those number ticket dispensers! Just a thought. Maybe I would have a better shot of washing my clothes. I also considered sitting on top of the washer until the load was done, but that would be kind of creepy on my part. I will be packing all my dirty clothes with me and never come back here again.","99":"Hands down best Bloody Mary ever. So many things in my BM, veggies  mmm bacon.  \"Nailed it\" it's an appetizer. I also had the burger with fries. Who knew fries could be so good. The presentation doesn't disappoint ether. Very nice. Great seating outside although we sat inside. Would love to see this restaurant near my hometown. Seriously. Get the BM. You rock Guy!","100":"They charged me twice what I expected to pay. The guy at the counter small-talked me, asked me if I wanted \"any additional insurance\" - I said no - and just initialed where he told me to, not noticing that one thing I initialed was collision waiver insurance, which I did not need and ended up doubling the original cost. He did not walk me through the additional cost and may even have been purposely misleading by distracting me with small talk. I am an experienced traveler and nothing like this has happened to me before. When I returned the car and expressed my surprise at the doubled cost they essentially said \"well you signed it\" and \"it's worth it anyway.\" I will never rent from this Payless again.","103":"This is my first yelp.  This restaurant was soo good I felt compelled to yelp about it.  Went for dinner with a friend of mine, really nice space.  All the staff were amazing!!  The chef even came out to our table which was cool.  And the Food, well I think even the most discerning top chef judges would be impressed.  A++ across the board.  We had the tenderloin and mac and cheese.  As well as the tomatoes two ways both are excellent choices.  I can't wait to go back.  Cielo, kudos.","105":"PRC consulted on 2 tile roof replacements at apartment communities we manage in the greater Phoenix area. PRC was thorough and caught a number of items the roofer needed to correct on both jobs. Their communication was great. A roof is a major investment and having a professional help manage installation is money well spent.\n\nThe specific services provided were initial condition and spec reports and roughly 5 job inspections per property.","106":"Awful place. Staff is not nice, very rude.  They never seem to want to help at all..Their service is not up to par & always out of bagels","107":"So many great this about Yoga Factory! Excellent teachers, very friendly and professional; they have been very patient with my practice but know how to push me to meet my goals. Amazing location very easily accessible very easy city parking! Nice large space in the hot room, never did I feel like my elbow room was compromised and the room can get PACKED! The facility is clean, neat and I love the choice of decor. Highly recommended for a first-timer or for someone who has a frequent practice very friendly and welcoming place.","108":"I have no idea what the owner's problem is, but he's incredibly rude. His wife, on the other hand is super nice (an odd mix).\n\nGreat space, rude owner and the coffee is average.","110":"Early this past January, I needed to find a furnished rental in the uptown Charlotte market. I really had no idea of how or where to look. I was glad when I found the Sold on Charlotte site.\nAs I recall I traded a few emails and phone calls with Chip and he was helpful in answering all my questions. We met at 626 North Graham and he showed me the unit there that was available.\nBetween Chip and Sylvia, I was \"sold\" on that apartment and we got the \"paperwork\" going. I enjoyed my stay there which lasted 6 months (3 months more that I initially signed up for).\nWhen it came time to give my notice, Sylvia gave me all the details I needed, and these were pretty much the same that were in our initial Lease Agreement. They were kind enough to give me ample notice to show the apartment during my last 30 days, without too much inconvenience. Sylvia helped me tie up a few loose ends and even arranged to pick up a lamp for me that needed to be repaired when I moved out.\n \nI would certainly reach out to the team at Sold on Charlotte again.\n \nKind regards,\n \nJohn D","111":"I really enjoyed coming here, it located near walnut st which meant parking was difficult. \n\nWhat I didn't realized was that hot pots where individualized. They gave a pot over an electric hot plate which you can adjust the temp. They also have hot water on the side in case you run out. Very fulfilling for $15.\n\nIt's a small area and they also have a section for you to customize your own sauces.","112":"Ok so I have purchased items from RC Wiley and have spent a lot of money but will never again. I had a $500 credit limit after I purchased my fridge and when  iwent to use it towards ny bed room purchase it was no longer available due to me paying it off too soon????? (Apparently since I paid $500 in 2months instead of $25 in 10 months) When we attempted to question what they meant and if there was anything that couldbe done the supervisor emele pretty much told us to take a flying leap -are you serious!!  So I spent my $2300 at Ashley furniture. RC Wiley apparently is balling and they don't need me to buy anything. Good luck! when u have poor customer service reps representing you like that their making your company look bad.","113":"Let me start by saying that I love Aveda which is why I decided to try this salon... and it was a big mistake. I explained what I wanted to the stylist, and even showed two photos. It's easy to get this cut wrong since it's short hair, so I also showed a photo of what exactly I DID NOT want. She asked what I didn't like about the photo and I explained it (it's a section in the back and she acted like she understood). The cut finishes, she spins me around and it is literally EXACTLY what I showed her that I didn't want. I was mortified and now trying to grow this hideous cut out. Nothing is blended and she butchered my hair. And to make matters worse, she wasn't even friendly! Heading to a different salon today to try and get it fixed.","114":"Place took forever... Come to find out that they didn't have my oil filter and a hour and a half into me waiting the Napa parts guy pulls up and 10 mins later it was done... Hmmm.. But they didn't even let me know what was going on! Never going back","115":"Cutest little dive bar in the city! Chill vibe, cheap (and yummy) drinks, delicious food, and family owned. Laura was an excellent bartender and made us feel right at home. Bonus points because it looks like a cute little house! A must-see if you're in the area.","117":"These darn Northerners really know how to make some goooood eggplant. I am obsessed, like seriously obsessed with their eggplant minced pork dish. it sounds so simple but never have I had it this good. Everything else on the menu is decent, the dumplings, XLB, noodles, etc., but the eggplant is to die for! Go for the authentic side of the menu avoid the Americanized dishes.","118":"the few times i ordered from here i was greatly disappointed. freezer burned strawberry ice cream, microwaved food and run of the mill breakfast.","119":"We have had a wonderful experience with Dr. Beals treating our son. He's been seeing him for about 8 months now and are very satisfied with the care he receives here. Dr. Beals is very helpful, we never feel rushed to get out of his office and he's patient in answering our questions. One of the things I most appreciate is that I've never felt like his solution is to throw a bunch of meds at my son. He's conservative and has started on low doses, moving up only when we were comfortable. My son loves coming to the appointments and playing with all the Minecraft toys in his office!","121":"I've been coming to Loco on mill since they opened. I love coming here especially on Sundays for football. They have all the games on, great bloodys, and awesome breakfast!  Loco is my local watering hole and I always have a great time with the staff.","123":"Rebel doesn't take credit cards and charges you to use debit. Not very convenient for people going to the lake. We will just fill up elsewhere. \nThe place is filthy, too.","125":"Hey....i just want to say, everytime I eat here, since the late 90's.  Nothing but good wings, good beer, and good times.  If the waiting staff is terrible, slow, non attentive, so be it.  I eventually get my food and beer, im busy either catching up with friends or pull out the cell phone and chat with friends.  Weird but there it is.  Have Fun here..........Cheers!","126":"While the prices are a bit high for a make-your-own pizza, the taste makes up for it. I love going to Seventh Street market, sitting Not Just Coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from Pure.  I've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market, and I can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated. So try to eat it fresh while there if possible.\n\nIf one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you, go for it, as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money.  I wanted what I wanted, though, so I ended up with a medium, thin crust, regular crust pizza with jalapenos, pepperoncini, onions and feta.  It was pretty expensive at $2\/topping = $20 med pizza. But it was delicious.\n\nThe arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to-die-for. I crave that dressing days later. So light and fresh but flavorful.","128":"Not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point. My girlfriend and I had dinner there last night, with reservations set for 6 p.m., were seated by 6:05. Our server William was awesome, was fast, attentative and really was one of the best servers we've encountered and we dine out a lot. We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh, hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound. \n\nThe only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside, May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top. I just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable. \n\nMy girlfriend and I will definitely be returning to pickle bills, we had a fantastic evening. Last thing to note, the service was great even though the place was packed!","132":"Best Thai food ever! Love the mango curry especially and everything. They have great bubble tea too. Very nice service very polite.","133":"We've shopped there for several years and always enjoyed the savings but this year I'm shopping for hoodies for the less fortunate.  Thank you Antigua.","134":"What an awesome pool party!!! I wish there was a tad more interactive aspects. I want hot girls and guys spraying champagne all over us or dancing with us.","135":"I LOVE this place! I have found the staff to be extremely knowledgable, beyond helpful and always willing to go above and beyond to do whatever they can to assist you. This store carries products that I can't find anywhere else besides online. They are great about returns if you have a finicky eater (like mine). \nI also love that they have no agenda when it comes to helping you select a certain food. They listen to what you're looking for and then make suggestions based on the info you've given them. They're also well versed in the latest pet food recalls (which are hard to stay on top of these days!)\nIf you sign up online, they offer discounts and specials all the time which helps with some of the pricier food. Organized, clean, and a huge selection. I have absolutely no complaints about this place... Except maybe that when they hold weekend pet adoptions I get depressed that I can't take all the animals home.","136":"I just had a terrible experience with Dr. Jennifer Vonya-Novak's front office.  I changed my primary care to Dr. Novak.  It took me 3 weeks to get an appointment because she ONLY DOES 4 NEW PATIENTS A DAY.  I waited the 3 weeks for what I was told was a 7:45 am appt.  I got to her office at 7:45 (actually 7:47 am according to my cell phone).  The door was locked and the office hours posted were 8:00- to 5:00.  I could see through the glass doors that there wasn't anyone at the desk area.  l left ,went home and called a 8 am, no answer.  Called again at 8:10 and the lady said I missed my appointment and could not be seen today.  She argued that the door is always open at 7:45.  She was unapologetic and offered me a next day appointment, like she was doing me a favor since I \"MISSED\" my appointment.  She kept calling me \"my dear\" as if I was incapable of knowing the appointment time.  I found her very condescending.  Needless to say, I will not be going to Dr. Novak and will let my friends know the office procedures there and the unbendable and arrogant rules!","138":"Was very excited for happy hour and heard great things. Food was less then average we were charged $10 for BREAD.  Most apps were greasy or fried and still spent $250 on happy hour menu for a group of 4. First review on yelp so cared enough to take the time to write this. Sorry won't come back.","139":"Excellent shortbread.  Koodos to Ms. Mary and her oh so good chocolate crunch shortbread cookies.","141":"Five stars! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!","142":"Oooh momma!\nThe flavor is strong with this one.\nClean, fast, friendly everytime. But not weird and sterile like Baja Fresh.\nGlad they're open again!","143":"LK is a great technician! He makes you feel relaxed and comfortable, as well as being extremely attentive to your nails.","144":"Oh. My. Gosh. I'm not going to write much except that it was DELICIOUS. I came here because of all the reviews and seriously it was worth the drive. I had the spring rolls and those were delicious. Then I had the noodle ye-saw with shrimp. And I pretty much licked my plate. And all the plates going by looked better and better. I'm already planning the next time I come here. And my server was a sweet sweet girl. Soft spoken but just the perfect server. I'd take a picture of my food but I dove in and cleaned my plate. Lol. Oh well. There are 254 pics for you to choose from.","146":"Amazing!!! Clean and pretty! Best service I've been in Las Vegas! Everyone are so nice! And all the design are perfect","149":"I work at Wells Fargo right next door to rubio's on 24th st and baseline and out main goal is too satisfy the customers using our vision and values. That being said rubios is so relative because everyday I go to rubios for lunch they make me feel at home and like a valued customer by showing quality service and going over and beyond the standard for me! They don't sale chimichangas but the manager George and the great cooks took it upon themselves to fry my burrito for me! George is a great leader and represents that franchise at a high level! Last but not least Priscilla the shift leader, lights up the whole room with her smile as soon as you are opening the door, as well delivering excellent service! Thanks rubios - DA'QUON  #YOURBANKTELLER","151":"PLEASE. Read this before you buy a session with her. About a year ago I bought a groupon here and having a horrible experience I've never used groupon for services again.\n\nYou get what you pay for - and in this case, less. Lesson learned.\n\nShe uses clumps of lashes that fall off within 12 hours. Your eyes will also be completely bloodshot from whatever glue she uses. I let her know and even sent pictures of my eyes because they were so red and painful I thought they were infected. She blamed it on me and offered to \"fix\" them for more money. I declined - there was no way I was letting her do any more damage. I have had my lashes done before and since with professionals and have never had that happen. I love the lash service at wishful winking and the spot in Liberty village. \n\nIcing on the badlashes cake: she was over an hour and a half late for my apt and claimed it was never booked. even when I showed her the text she had sent me with the confirmation.  The whole time I was waiting my gut was yelling NO and I should have listened.\n\nJust no.","152":"We used Creative Bridal for our Vegas wedding at MGM Grand as part of our wedding package. Originally it was only to get my husband tuxedo for the wedding. Unfortunately, my wedding dress from David's had an alteration issue and the back of my dress ripped when I was finally trying it on for the last time the day before the wedding. Since we were on our way to get a tux fitting for my husband he thought it would be best to ask them if they can help us fix it because I was in tears since the dress was ripped so bad that my butt was hanging out. Britney picked us up at MGM and brought us and during conversation she did say let's look at the dress and see what can be done. Kelly and Brittany did just that, they quickly placed me in my dress while Taisha took my husband in to get his tux fitted. All while making sure he didn't see me. I'm so grateful for all three ladies! I highly recommend them! (Sorry if I got anyone names wrong)","158":"I so disagree with a couple of the reviews I read. Dr Miller is one of the best doctors I've ever seen and I've seen and worked with many as a medical professional. She is very detailed and shows concern regarding all aspects of my health. I have referred several people to her.   Highly recommended!!!","159":"My experience went from bad to worse.  This place is filthy and the employees are extremely rude. I pawned an item and when I went back to pick it up the place we closed.  I went back first thing in the morning to pick up the item. I was told that the finance charge was double for being a day late.","161":"I've received great service and highly recommend Stone Law. I've been a client for many years and can attest they do great work!","165":"The 5 for 6 'til 7 is so awesome and such a great deal! I wasn't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans. I would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly! We got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full.  I have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal :)","166":"It was my first time here and I was definitely\nImpressed. The groomers work and etiquette was lovely. I usually need the works when it comes to my little schweenie mix. ;) I'm glad I went to her and will most definitely be back!","169":"Horrible experience I went in to get a full set french tips the guy who did them was very rude never said a word only yanked at my hand he cut my real nails after I told him not to. I complained about bubbles and dust inside the acrylic they acted like they couldn't see it. Two days later my nails are lifting and more bubbles appeared. I will never go here again and hope others don't waste their time or money at this place.","171":"Also don't believe when they say they will give you a credit for unsatisfactory meal because for some reason they have a tendency to forget they said it.  They no longer have to worry about my business.","173":"I hope that every person who follows me, everyone I know and anyone contemplating this establishment reads this first and NEVER bothers to give this place with the crappiest staff of all time a second thought. Earlier today my friend and I dropped in to grab some lunch.. the staff either all lost their dogs this morning, or just have the absolute worst attitudes you've ever seen in human beings. Not only was the nasty woman who served me avoiding any type of pleasantry but she was yelling across two other workers and a line of patrons asking what I wanted from the other end of the shop. When I asked the server for lettuce, onion and roasted red peppers on my sandwich she quite literally moaned very loud and followed it with yelling \"ughhhhh god help me!\" Before adding my toppings to my turkey sandwich. When one of the other servers asked us if our food was for \"here or to go\" the original server says aloudly \"to-go hopefully!!!\" Wtf... I'd love to know who this terrible human being thinks she is! I found my jaw on the floor more than once, wondered why she thought I was such a headache, and my friend and I decided right there that we would NEVER return nor would we let this review go untold to everyone we know!! I feel the owners somehow have to be to blame! How the hell do you allow someone so miserable represent your livelihood? You don't expect livelihood for very much longer, that's how. \nPs... maybe this server will look a little less \"I just woke up\" at her next job.","175":"Unbelievable experience start to finish.\n\nWe had a reservation for 9pm Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders. There is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice. Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.\n\nOur party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.\n\nThe menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.\n\nFor dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.\n\nEvery wine pairing we tried was amazing.\n\nUnfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations. \n\nExpect to be here for a while. Our reservation was at 9 and we only finished eating at 11:37- and we're not slow eaters. I think the wait had to do with our party being big and the rest of the place being packed","176":"Wild every night! My favorite place hands-down in AZ! The night life here is contagious and Iv never been disappointed with there Sunday fun day! Every Sunday they have a corn hole competition and crazy drink specials like penny refills!! You also have to try there duck and pork tacos or there Hefe Hamburger! My favorite margarita on the menu is the la chica flaca. If you want a fun place to get lunch and a few drinks or looking to go crazy night this is the spot.","178":"Service was amazing, Christina was extremely tentative and took care of our whole group. Asked about splitting checks from the beginning which for a large group is very convenient!","180":"The gang at Sun Valley Stereo is definitely top notch. Ryan gets right to the point and saw what I was interested in, and we worked together to verify that all the parts were in to upgrade my 2004 RX-8 with a Pioneer 4000NEX touchscreen and back-up camera before I drove 90 minutes for the work. When I first left there was some adjustments needed. They took me back in without hesitation and made everything right. The installer was committed to treating my car like it was his own. He took the extra steps to make it all right, and even fixed the hatch door to my 12-volt socket. Now that's going the extra mile! 6-stars!","182":"I have been there for 5 different tattoos now and could not be happier with the work done. My artist has been Eric R. and he has always done an incredible job. His attention to detail is second to none. I have recommended to friends who have been incredibly pleased with the work done. All the artists there are friendly and make the experience that much better. 5 stars and then some. Highly recommend to anyone!","184":"Please try this place. The food is incredible and you can tell the people that run it are super-appreciative of everyone that comes through the door. They are very proud of their food and they make sure to tell you it's all made in house - i.e. no cans of anything. The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.\n\nThe enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were saut\u00c3\u00a9ed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.\n\nWarning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy. Those were the spiciest enchiladas I've ever had, but I appreciate the spice. My gf, however, was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas. \n\nBy the way, the carnitas were excellent, as well.\n\nThis place gets five stars and I can't wait to go back. Please, please try this place. It was empty when I walked in and that's a shame. They should have a lot more business if it was all based on the quality of their food and service. It's also very affordable. Chicken enchiladas were $9 and the carnitas were somewhere around there (maybe $12).","186":"What a mess. Been in line over an hour and there are still about 10 people in front of me. Should've stuck with the company I usually use....next counter or two over. Came here based on SW Airlines suggestion and email. Ugh","187":"I don't normally say things are the best but these are the best fajitas I've ever had. Chips are perfect ,salsa is perfect, bean dip is perfect, and the best fried ice cream I've ever had. Plus the service is great.","188":"Great venue. Every seat in the house is awesome. Been here twice, once for Britney and another time for Jlo. Both were fantastic performances; sexy, sultry, and high energy! Love, love them and this venue!","189":"I did not visit the Kent office, but the office of Dr. Brown in Fairlawn. She was lacking in compassion, clarity, kindness, and professional ethics. She judged me based on my  pharmacutical history, and did not even glance at the stack of medical records I brought with me. I have been treated by some of the best in the country at John Hopkins and Walter Reed, and to be treated so unprofessionally in this office was an insult to the profession. Do NOT waste your time with Dr. Brown!","191":"I had THE BEST VEGAN Gardein chicken plate with broccolini. I was blown away!!! The decor is cute! Nicely dimly lit, It was romantic and very chic. I recommend coming if you're a vegan looking for a good dinner!","193":"Thank you so much Tanner!  Fantastic job.  Super nice clean shop.  Respectful, professional.  Just great.  \n\nthanks again.","196":"Seeing \"Chicago\" in the name of a taco shop gave me a little pause, but the food and employees are both 5 stars. \n\nThe Asada fries were awesome! The meat was well seasoned and had that perfect grilled crunch that I love. You can choose nacho cheese or cheddar,  I chose the cheddar, and they put a good portion on.  It's topped with Pico,  sour cream   and a huge scoop of fresh guac. Lovely dish!\n\nI also had a pastor taco, which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere.  The pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled. \n\nOverall a great experience: Food was great and the staff was very friendly.  The owner came to the table to  ask how the food was and we talked for a few minutes. He was genuinely interested in feedback and his passion for cooking and providing a great experience for his customers was very evident.\n\nI recommend everyone stop in and give this place a try.  It is now on my list of regular lunch spots when I am on the N. Side.","198":"Went to Vegas again Memorial Day Weekend but this time with my girlfriends so wanted them to try this place since LOVED it so much when I came with hubby.\n\nThis time tried the Angry Dog and just as amazingly deelish!!!\n\nFriends got Chili (homemade by Buldogis) Dog, Bulgogi Bowl, Fries, and again the Euro Fries with kimchee added and they LOVED it too!   My 2 friends who had the Chili Dog said the chili was very good! One of them is not even a hotdog fan and loved it :)\n\nIF you are EVER in Vegas THIS is a MUST!!!","200":"Love this place!! Delicious! I just wish it was closer to my house. Other than that, I have no complaints. The price point is reasonable and the menu selection is great. Couldn't ask for anything else!","203":"Perfect Grilled Cheese was amazing and worth a repeat  visit.  Chicken club lacked unique flavor and was average.  The BLT was great with the bread making the sandwiches.  Now for the sides: tomato soup was delicious and a perfect complement to the grilled cheese.  Shoe string fries were great, nothing not to like about them and the green pea salad in peanut sauce was delicious.  We will definitely return for another try!","205":"I went here today to upgrade to an iPhone X. They were awesome to work with. They mirrored everything from my current phone to the new one. That saved me so much time and aggravation if I had to do it. They were very knowledgeable and friendly! Highly recommend!","207":"As soon as I parked my car, this rude elderly lady comes out saying these parking spaces are reserved...I UNDERSTAND AND CAN READ THAT ON YOUR SIGN lady.  Just because my other family members are dinning at Hong Kong Garden for Dim Sum does not automatically mean that EVERYONE is looking to eat there.  I was and had a craving for deli sandwiches in which I did ended up walking in to purchase 2 as planned (receipt still in hand).  Don't go around assuming and start off with horrible service.  I ended up keeping my car parked there the WHOLE afternoon taking a space just because that lady was rude.  \n***Also would be nice to offer water for your customer that is waiting for his to-go order***","210":"I am so blown away by this sophisticated & beautiful hotel. One of the best in Las Vegas. The decor is breathe taking, and this place always smell like a magical garden. With so many top notch restaurants, spa services, shows, and clubs to choose from. It's vegas luxury! The last time I stayed here, July 2011, it was such a BIG disappointment. There was a total of 8 of us. One of the bed broke and fell flat to the floor (no, there were no foul play)! 6 out 8 of us left with some kind of bug bite that looks like a terrible case of eczema\/rash! The mechanic curtain didn't work. The main T.V. didn't work. Actually, disappointed is an understatement, WE WERE DISGUSTED! How can this 5star resort & hotel failed us so miserably!!!!!? \n\n(please view pictures of rash)","211":"The brussel sprout nachos are really as good as the other reviewers have mentioned! I've had them more then a few times and everyone always loves them, be careful because they can easily fill you up! Individual tacos and the burritos are great too. I've also had a few of their salads and love them, big a portion sizes. Great classic margarita as well, love this place for groups esp on Sunday when is all day happy hour!","213":"Gluten free options promised, so we tried a turkey sandwich with avocado.   Large portion--very delicious.  5 choices of iced tea blends(free refills) and coffee choices made for a perfect girls' afternoon. Lots of seating outside on the covered patio.  Their parking fills quickly, but plenty of options on street or at the Municipal Bldg.","214":"We had a great lunch experience today at Rubios. It didn't start out that way but was quickly turned while we were checking out since we were using promotions.\n\nWe used the Yelp check in offer for a free entree with the purchase of a drink which is an awesome way to try something new. It was also ocean day insulated bag day which is really nice and will be used when grocery shopping this summer or transporting hot food to keep it warm. \n\nWe had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco. The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup. \n\nI really recommend going to Rubios for a lighter refreshing meal, try the fish tacos and sign up for their club for emails on special offers.","215":"So I've been coming here for years and have never had any issues until today. I ordered what I've always ordered. A bean burrito, a taco and a drink. It cost over $9 dollars!! The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy\/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!! They don't false advertise there either! Furious!  Their food and prices have gone downhill fast! They lost mine and my family's business for good!!","216":"Amazingly professional & compassionate staff. We recently lost an animal member of the family, and I was pleasantly surprised today with a follow up hand written sympathy card personalized and singed by the whole group. Thank you!","217":"Came to this place based on yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Got the chicken wings to start, kao soi with chicken and an dish from the chefs special - Steamed fish coconut curry. Chicken wings were good, especially when hot, the sauce gelatinized as it cooled. Kao soi was the best I've ever had, an excellent portion ans the chicken was very tender. The the fish coconut curry was good too, wasn't much of a curry but was still very flavourful. Service was fast and people were so friendly and kind. Will definitely go back to try other menu items.","219":"Ikea....an experience!\n\nI adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.\n\nWhen you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! \n\nIkea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars\/trucks\/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!\n\nDo yourself a favor, plan a day! Go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom, have lunch in the cafe.... rest a bit, then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires! \n\nIkea....an experience!","220":"Don't let the location or the look of the building fool you. When I tell you this is THE BEST PLACE FOR AUTHENTIC MEXICAN EATS! I cannot stop eating their taco gringos Omg so yummy and everything is cooked to order right in front of you. This is the only place that can compare to the Hispanic food in California! You have to try it! DEFINITELY DESERVES MORE THAN 5 stars!!!!","222":"Go. Seriously. You will not be disappointed one bit!\n\nWe were craving breakfast food and decided to check this place out. We shared a skillet and a few breakfast sides, each of which were cooked to perfection and super tasty. The atmosphere here is cute, clean, and just what you want for enjoying your breakfast. \n\nWhat really made our day being here was our awesome server, Tina. She was so cool, upbeat, easy to talk with, and was the most accommodating server you could ever hope to have. We plan on returning for more good eats and to see Tina again. :)","227":"From out of state and rolled up.  Richard greeted us and we had great customer service.  Thanks so much.","228":"Hank's definitely stays on my list of places that wow me. Great atmosphere from the bar area with live music, to the great booth in the dining room with all the hustle and bustle of the staff creating that fine dining experience.  We felt very comfortable and well taken care of. Even had the manager share a bottle of wine with us! A memorable evening.","229":"My husband and I used to order from here more than I'd like to admit (almost weekly). The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. \n\nLast time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.\n\nI paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. \n\nWhen we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin. \n\nI walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"I'll be right with you.\" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say \"Wow, you are really something else.\" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. \n\nI honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction\/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.\n\nI realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.","230":"Just found out about this secret treasure!  Love this studio and the staff!!!! I haven't practiced yoga in a studio for a while, but this place is very welcoming to Yogi's of all levels! I love power flow with Shannon- she's got a great energy and inspires me to challenge myself! Love love love this studio! If you are going for the first time, park off Glenway by the bank- its easier to find! :)","231":"Amazing service, great vibe, and fair prices.  Their Asian\/Hawaiian fusion was perfect.  We'll be back!","233":"Dined here a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night -- actually sat at the bar with my three fellow diners and had an absolutely amazing evening -- food, wine, service all made for a perfect experience.\n\nTried almost all the appetizers and 'small plates' and they were exceptional.\nStandouts were: almond spread, harcha bread, quinoa salad, beef kefta\n\nShared a fish tagine for 4 and it was also excellent!\n\nHighly recommend this place - I know we'll be back!","234":"I love this place. I come here whenever I'm in town for business. The taco Tuesday deals are unbelievably amazing. The tacos are only two dollars each, but they could be charging much more for the quality that they are. They also have a good IPA on tap that is only five dollars a pint. All of the staff is incredibly nice and they have great music here too. I also love the fact that there's tons of monitors everywhere so you can see games from every angle of the venue. They also have a great outdoor seating area that is right on the sidewalk and located on a busy downtown corner which suits all the people watchers well.","235":"Great food and greatCustomer service.They messed up my order and when they realized they apologized and returned our money.","242":"I'm a fan of BMW.  My X3 lasted me 10 years and although there were a few hiccups, I can still say that car was pretty darn reliable and I got my money's worth. But sometimes, you just have to let go and find a replacement.\n\nI did my research and considered getting a Mini, Fiat or a Lexus. My loyalty is with BMW. I locked in on a particular car and off to the dealer I went. We were walking around the lot looking at other models and colors when a car salesman saw us and helped me get my car. My sister kept throwing her ideas and opinions as to what car I should get. I told David (sales advisor) what features I need and we ended up with the first car I was looking at.\n\nThen, the dreaded test driving the car. I'm not a big fan of driving a car that isn't mine...or driving, period! I think convincing me to test drive took the most time and David told me to just drive around the lot but that was a trick! There was a part of the lot that's blocked off by a semi and the only way around it is to get on the road. My sister was a backseat driver as if I needed to be more anxious but David kept me calm. He's so funny. We made it back to the dealership in one piece.\n\nI signed my papers and wrote my check but it was gym time so, we told David we'd come back for the car after the gym since they still had to detail it anyway. It was the most entertaining car-buying experience ever. We were all laughing and chatting about cars, the gym, nutrition, Hello Kitty, Yoda, etc. David explained and showed me what my car can do and at the end he said, \"I wish all my clients are as fun as you.\"\n\nI get follow-up phone calls and e-mails and if I have any questions about my car, David responds quickly.  If you ever need\/want a car, contact David Politzer - he is fantastic and he has a nice profile picture on his business card too.","243":"This place rules! Best tacos in town and not too pricy! Always clean and has an awesome patio.   Staff is friendly, very welcoming.  Will def be back!","245":"Simply the best place to call home.  All the amenities, cool vibe, great pool scene, 24 hour concierge service, same day laundry, dedicated parking, secure entry.  HOA reasonable.  What's not to like in condo living?","247":"Azzip Pizza is literally SO good. I have been there so many times and each time I get a \"Big Zip\" for $8.22. The place is amazing and the pizza cooks in about 2 minutes. It is the build your own concept and I have never had a bad experience there. Also, I go there about 4 times a week.. Don't worry I hit the gym, sometimes..","250":"Just took the 6:30am class - My muscles have been so sore from crossfit and I needed a good stretching. I really need more yoga in my life! The class was fantastic! A nice 60 minute class, heated and the music was lovely. The yoga instructor's voice was soothing - which I think is soo important. \n\nWhat a great class.. I feel refreshed! A great studio as well - nice and roomie. Looking forward to my next class!","253":"Awesome food and service! Really wish we had one in Oahu! Our servers were on it! Thank you for working it out and fitting in our party of 9!","254":"I went here yesterday and I got the best service I ever got at a restaurant. The waiter helped me on the grill constantly checked on me to see if everything was ok, the food was great and so was the service and everything was A++++ pricing was great as well it came out to around $18.\n\nI am going back to Vegas for my Birthday next month I will try there sushis.","257":"A tale of two locations (AKA: AVOID 7700 S Autoplex, GO TO 616 W Baseline)\n\nFirst the good: 616 W Baseline\n\nI have been a loyal repeat customer of Cobblestone Auto Spa ever since I encountered Jared, one of the managers at the 616 W Baseline. \n\nThe first time I went there I had my car detailed for $150 after discounts. The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.\n\nI am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.\n\nCOBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!\n\nNow the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex\n\nI first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.\n\nI then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.\n\nI then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.\n\nWhen I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.\n\nFinally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.\n\nI went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.\n\nThe next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. \n\nI knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.\n\nI suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.\n\nAs a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.\n\nI went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. \n\nThey reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.\n\nJared to the rescue:\n\nI took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.\n\nLesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!\n\nCOBBLESTONE, BAD MANAGERS MAKE FOR A BAD STAFF. GREAT MANAGERS MAKE FOR A GREAT STAFF.","259":"The location was excellent and the restaurant was beautiful. The food was awful and our server was very rude and impolite.\nWe were a group of 6 people and whatever we ordered was worse than another one!\nEven my little daughter who loves french fries couldn't eat them because they weren't fresh and she thought that they were artificial!!!","260":"My favorite burger joint! Simple, yet delicious! Service is always great with cheerful greetings and happy smiles.","262":"Juan's is ALWAYS busy because it's ALWAYS good. It's great food, but the excellent, friendly service is what keeps people coming back. I've been here dozens of times...date nights, with family, with kids, girls nights. Always wonderful. Try the shrimp ceviche!","264":"Fabulous. A friend took me here last night. Wonderful food, we had panang curry, duck fried rice and Chilean sea bass.  What a wonderful combination of flavors.","266":"Worse than before.\nOverpriced, and HORRIBLE service.\n\nWhen a group says \"We're really thirsty. Could you please bring water while we look at the menu?\" You'd better frickin' BRING IT! \n\nOur waiter was pushy, rude, and S...L...O...W...\nWhen we said that we weren't interested in hearing the specials, he read them anyway. \n\nHe constantly tried to upsell us. Every order placed was followed by a pause, and \"Well, you know what would be really good...?\" followed by a big description of a more expensive item or an add-on.\n\nThe desperately needed water took almost twenty minutes to get to our table.\n\nThe table next to us, who was seated at least five minutes after us, received their water, drinks, and first course before we even got our water. \n\nDo I sound like I'm obsessing about water? In the desert, dehydration is no joke, and it's indicative of the quality (bad - very very bad) of service that we received.\n\nThe sushi was good, but not great.\nThe main courses were simple but extremely expensive.\nAll sides were extra.\nWe spent about $250 for three people on very basic food and a glass of wine each.\n\nNever again.\nNever never never.","267":"Hands down, this is the best pizza place in Mentor! Their pizza is so delicious that the smell alone is enough to make you drool! The cheesy bread is soft and cheesy and just goodness. The pizza is good for leftovers and the next day. The service and staff is very friendly. 5 stars for sure!","270":"Do your research people, this place is completely unprofessional. I went in for a Juvederm procedure in my lips, and I was very disappointed by the way I looked right after the procedure and even several weeks after. My lips were extremely painful, swollen, bruised, and disproportioned. This place is not a good place to go to for lip augmentation, be aware. Choose a good MD.","272":"It's extremely annoying that the Venetian chooses to broadcast Fox News at their VIP lounges against their customers' will and employees' will.  I would consider this harassment since neither have a choice to change the channel. I've tried. I have complained to the employees who state they are not able to change the channel. Trust me, the Venetian customers and their employees do NOT want to be forced to watch Fox News. Please change to a neutral channel or CNN which provides more transparent news.","273":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner evening and all I can say is it was awesome. Be prepared the drinks are powerful here and we made the mistake of getting Tequila shots on the side..but the frozen Margarita house drinks did not need it. Needless to say we took our time drinking and eating so we could travel home safely. Fantastic time...we will definitely visit this restaurant again... by the way ... I had the chicken shrimp and spinach entree and John had the mahi-mahi tacos... so good!","274":"I remember going to this salon a few years ago and I loved how fast thier service was(under 45 min). I'm glad that that hasn't changed. I did a refill on my seaweed bio gel nails with an air brushed french manicure because I saw it here on yelp and I didn't even know that was an option. My nail tech was nice she understood what I wanted and was very fast( without sacrificing quality). Sadly my only complain is that this place is located in markham which is out of my way. It would be cool if they opened up another location in the north York or downtown area.","275":"I'm a regular at chipotle in California, this is my first visit to this chipotle on s.las Vegas strip.this is pretty new place I think, I took a veggie bowl in which the rice was undone and the fajitas were all burnt, the quantity offered was less than usual. I'm very unhappy with this place.","276":"What an incredible experience this was. There is nothing particular special about the neighborhood atmosphere, but don't let that deter you. We were seated on the outside patio which was lovely on a warm summer evening. The service was exceptional as the staff was incredibly kind and attentive, but it was the food that really made this experience. From the crispy shrimp appetizer and beef tartar, to the octopus special and veal flank steak, the food was simply amazing. Unfortunately, we're from the San Francisco area so may not be back any time soon, but if this were in our home town neighborhood, we would come back weekly!","277":"I have taken my family to this place before.  We were quite happy with the service and food.  Recently, I bought a groupon for this restaurant.  We were not happy at all with the service and food.  First, they ask if we were using groupon and they marked it in a separate sheet.  We had no service at all.  The restaurant was not full and we saw other tables had their food while they order after us.  We waited for almost 30 minutes only two dishes came.   We spoke to the manager and the Waiter for the rest of the orders.  They said to check on our orders.  My kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came.  Finally when the order dish came and it was very salty.  We would definitely not recommend this place if you plan to buy Groupon.  We felt we were second class.  We would prefer to go elsewhere where we get excellent service and much better vegetarian food and we don't mind paying the little extra,such as graceful vegetarian by market village.","279":"These guys really are great, easy to work with, and provide a valuable service.\n\nI worked with Sammy to coordinate a night out with 10 girls for a bachelorette party in Vegas.  We decided to go to Tryst.  Sammy was very patient in taking multiple phone calls and answering all my questions, even throwing in a couple of extra perks at my request.  The pre-pay service is great--the company takes the total cost of the evening and divides it per person, creating a link online where each girl can go and pay ahead of time.  We didn't have to deal with a large bill or everyone's credit cards at the end of the night.  It was SO easy.\n\nSomeone from the company was in constant contact with me leading up to our night out.  Sammy, knowing how large of a group we had and how important a good table was to us, called me the night of to let me know they'd had a different, better table open up, and that he was giving it to us at no extra charge.  \n\nCraig was our host for the evening.  He contacted me promptly to provide detailed instructions on where to meet him and when.  Craig was waiting to greet us and, as promised, walked us right into the club and to our table, which had our bottles, mixers and waitresses waiting.  Craig stopped back a couple of times before leaving to make sure we were settled and having a good time.\n\nI contacted Sammy a couple more times throughout the weekend for various things, and he was more than helpful even though we weren't using them for additional reservations or nights out.  \n\nPlanning ahead is the way to go when it comes to Vegas, and while I don't think you HAVE to use an outside VIP company to plan, I don't really see a disadvantage to doing so.  I would definitely call Red Carpet VIP again.","280":"The worst. Got there 45 minutes after the store was supposed to be open and they weren't ready.  Ordered a sandwich and the oven hadn't been turned on.  I asked how long and the employee said a few minutes. 8 minutes later oven still not preheated and I let her know I had to go.  She then pulls the sandwich out of the oven.  Cleary the sandwich would not have been prepared correctly.  I did not take sandwich and had to leave to get to an appointment. My  quick stop for a coffee and breakfast to go was over 15 minutes.  When I sent in a complaint to the head office the slow response was they couldn't give me a credit but would send over coupons for a couple of beverages.  That is ridiculous.  I wanted a refund on the sandwich I never took. I pass by this second cup 5 days a week. I'm going to keep on driving and stick with Starbucks. You should also steer clear. Best example of the worst service.","281":"I went to Dr. Goth for a couple procedures, including wisdom teeth and to have a suspicious oral growth removed. Only one word - fantastic! His staff is excellent, and his art in dentistry and patient care unsurpassed. Cut and dried - Dr. Goth was outstanding. He is the man to see in the Pittsburgh area.","282":"2-3 years ago I found LifeScape Medical Associates randomly and started going there since then. Paying an annual fee, I'm expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level; however, LifeScape disappointed me again and again over the years. I have to give credit to their office environment though, it's always quiet and clean, and the receptionists are always friendly.\n\nThere're a few reasons I don't like it there:\n1. I feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine\/samples\/tests, and some of them are not necessary at all. For example, the doctor suggested me with a special blood test, twice, saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost. I believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab. Later I got a bill for almost $2000 (I know LifeScape always charges high prices, luckily I have a good health insurance so i don't really care, but still, $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) I called my insurance company, my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion. I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did. I'm really disappointed. How can people trust them if they do business like that!!! What's worse, up to this day, they still haven't informed me anything about the bill, nor the blood test result itself.\n\n2. The waiting time in the clinic is too long. I ALWAYS have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time. I know the doctor is busy, but the patient's time is precious too. I don't like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor. And when I finally get to meet with the doctor, I can tell that she is not patient enough. She seems in a hurry, I know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient.\n\n3. They don't have xRay machines. If you are need to get some xRay or CT scan done, I suggest you going somewhere else, even some small clinics have xRay machines. \n\nI normally only write positive reviews online, but this time i want to let people know about what's really going on there. I would NOT go there any more and I do NOT recommend LifeScape to anybody.","284":"Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.\n\nWe walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  \n\nMy family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  \n\nIn the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.","286":"Worst service ever.  Only one here and took 10 minutes to get one drink out.  3 people behind the counter including the manager.  They were all talking and doing other things","287":"Driving late at night we were lucky to find the last room available at this location. The front desk clerk Breanne was super nice and helpful. The hotel felt welcoming and clean walking in, and the room was no different! I'd definitely stay again. We did not explore the other amenities.","288":"Christian and joe!! 5 stars!\nThanks for the quick resolution!\nGot the tech scheduled as best they could as quick they could and we're professional the whole time.","290":"--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! \n\nThis is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. \n\nManagement provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!","291":"Im obsessed with this place! Best dishes to try include: \n\nPozole- which is really filling! Great for when is freezing outside.... \n\nTacos dorados- they are the best ones I have tried in the city! \n\nEnchiladas during the morning on weekends are the best as well, delicious! And if you really want to try real huevos rancheros try them here!!!!! There are some other places in the neighbourhood to claim to offer them and trust me none of the are authentic as they are here. Always a great experience, keep the good work! Prices are so good also considering the freshness and quality of food, one of the best places to eat without breaking your pocket.","294":"The food was great Our server Karu was the bomb he was cool, very nice and good looking guy. It's the perfect spot for the bring friends and group. Great atmosphere and great menu choices.  SPICY... but its good haha.  Defenitely coming back!!!","295":"Chilaquiles is on point. I bought them last and saved them for breakfast today. The sauce and tortillas were SO good!","296":"I e-mailed head office months ago about a lousy experience at their Yonge & College Street location and never received a response. Was never a huge fan to begin with but that confirmed things for me. \n\nOh, and the Cobb salad doesn't have chicken in it anymore...what a rip off!","297":"Awful. Nearly inedible... even for airport food. \nDon't push the \"prompt service\" button on the table. The waitress said that they ignore it. \nKeep walking.","298":"Much better coffee than the big chains.  This is a great place for a quick lunch or breakfast and the drive through makes caffeine fill ups easy.","300":"This restaurant is a real local secret. Open since 1965, the original owner and chef was still cooking in the kitchen on a Monday night at 10:00 when most restaurants were closed. So happy I found it. Amazing food, wonderful authentic Italian atmosphere and friendly, and well-timed  service in English, French or Italian!","301":"Just a couple days ago, I adopted my little Sayuri from the Arizona Humane Society.  The entire process was seamless, and it was evident it was in the societies best interest to make sure these lovable pets find the right home.  \n\nI first went in to see a couple of puppies, and I really like 2 in particular.  Because I already have a dog at home, and my boyfriend wasn't able to join me, I put one of them on hold (they will hold your pet for the day) and went back a few hours later.  It is required that if you already have a dog, you must do an introduction to make sure it is a good match.  My dog loved Sayuri, but was not as fond of the other dog.  I like to say that my dog chose our new puppy :).  \n\nWhen adopting a puppy, you also recieve a free exam through the VCA Animal Hospitals.  I think that's wonderful since adopting a rescue dog can be intimidating.\n\nOverall, the facility is extremely clean, the staff is more than helpful, and on top of it all, they are about as friendly as you can imagine. These people have hearts of gold.  I would absolutely recommend the AZ humane society to anyone who wants to add to their family.","302":"This is for service only.  On a 2000 Honda Accord Vtec EX.  Had major service done here: 1. timing belt, water pump, tune up, etc.  Basically everything that was recommended and told needed to be done.  Wanted the car to be reliable and not have any issues so I went ahead with all the required maintenance and then some.\n\n1 month after all this major service the radiator blew open coming back from flagstaff.....Ok so I understand things break etc.  I take it to Arrowhead Honda Service and the explanation was since I replaced the water pump with a new one it must have increased pressure in the system. Since the radiator was old the new water pump found a weakness in the radiator.  I was then told it was common??? OK I get the explanation, but if that was the case a month a go and common knowledge why not recommend replacing the radiator with the major service so the car would not leave me stranded???\n\nThey also had recommended the power steering pump be replaced, system flushed etc.  Hate when its not done right the first time?  Had to bring it back and wait for them to get air out of the system so the new power steering pump would stop making noise.  \n\nI went to this dealership service department because they know Honda's better then me and what breaks, unfortunately even when I changed everything they initially recommended they still missed other items that should of been changed.  I have not been back since this mistake....","303":"Dr. Roach and staff are wonderful. Keisha is an amazing groomer too! We love this place. It is clean, efficient, and a state of the art facility.","304":"I love this location. Christina was our server this morning and she was fantastic. As a former waitress I understand how hectic and overwhelming a morning shift can get but she was attentive and very friendly and always kept her cool even with the tons of tables she had. \n\nThe food was brought to us within ten minutes of ordering (successfully taming the hangry beast that was brewing) and any modification to our order was done correctly! The food itself was pretty good. \n-- I highly recommend the banana nutella crepes. \n\nOverall I was very impressed with this recent visit. Keep up the good work!","305":"Good luck getting an appointment  before you end up in the E.R.","306":"I'm not into seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he loves it.. There were other options then seafood that made me happy...and my husband said his was great..","309":"My companion and I went to Living Kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it! My companion got the Arugula Harvest salad and I got the Pad Thai. The Arugula Harvest salad was very tasty and all of the components came together well. The Pad Thai was also very flavorful and had an awesome sauce which had a good afterburn to it. I would highly recommend coming here to try the food vegan, vegetarian, or otherwise.","310":"why do these guys suck? how hard is it to ring a bell to see if the receiver is home?  I've had multiple issues with them, and wish Amazon would stop using them.","313":"This is the worst gym I've ever been to, and I've grown up in the gym business. These guys only care about your money and nothing more. When I joined I later had to cancel with them because I had to meet with my National Guard unit and I didn't know what kind of schedule I'd have. They seemed understanding and said it wasn't a problem. At this time I would have rated this gym very good, because I had fun with no issues. I even told them I'd probably start back up here after I know what schedule looked like. So I stop going after my month expired because I cancelled(even on my attendance sheet it said it was my last and only month.) I later check my bank statement and they charged me again, okay no big deal probably a mistake. I call them, no answer. Okay that's fine I'll email them explaining the mistake. I'll give them a few days to get back to me max. Hear nothing from them. Call them again, no answer. Call them again they finally answered. I explain the situation with guy that answers and he says \"Oh yeah i got your email but I forgot to call you.\". At this point I'm a little rubbed wrong with they're crap customer service. Then after that he tells me no I haven't cancelled and I'm going to have to pay another two months worth. He tells me I must have misunderstood him (he speaks broken English so he must have misunderstood me when I cancelled with him a month prior to this). He won't help me out at all, just says I have to pay more. Thank god I have Navy Federal for a bank because I call them after this and they let me know these guys shouldn't be changing me. They repay me for what the gym took and put a dispute on the gym, they also put a stop payment on the gym. Well sure and behold I get charged by them AGAIN and I call my bank asking why did this happen? Turns out this gym is manually putting my card information in to get past the stop payment. I ask what I can do. They say to email them so I have proof i contacted them in case they try to lie. So I email these dirt bags and guess what once again nothing but they email me the SCHEDULE FOR THE CLASSES. Once again my bank is helping me, thank goodness. Not veteran friendly.","314":"Freaking BOMB Macaroni & Cheese and Everything Else was Awesome as well great Service again everything was OUTSTANDING","315":"I ordered the Akropolis Pizza and Pork Gyro. The first thing I noticed when the pizza came out was how vibrant the toppings were! You can tell the veggies are fresh just by looking at them. The gyro was one of the best I've had and the fries were awesome. Great service! They really care about giving you a good experience. I will definitely be back!","316":"Worst experience ever.... I guess it's my first time left negative comments but definitely for me won't go back anymore. I have made reservation for the day and when I arrive they told me they don't remember they have confirmed my appointment n already other guests waiting there but they re closing in a hour. Still the lady told me it's ok they could do it. So I sit down n soak my feet into cold water... n after 20 mins, the lady told me n another girl that actually they could not help us today as they re closing soon n one of the staff actually have to leave soon... so I don't know how good they re as I guess I ll never know:(","319":"Will not offer refund and will charge you for cancelled flight. Even a month in advance i tried and they will not work with me. Dont use this cut rate airline","321":"The nicest hotel I've ever stayed in in Vegas! Found a great deal during the week and couldn't pass it up. Clean, staff is friendly and there's so much food to choose from downstairs! Pretty convenient location on the strip as well. Definitely will stay here again.","322":"A wonderful dinner experience! Hubby and I came couple months ago, it was our first time at Sushi Samba. We didn't have reservations, but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar. \nWe had the A5 Wagyu gyoza, was tender and not overdone, Tuna tataki, Chicken Samba was a good size portion, El topo roll, chef sashimi selections, and Tonkotsu ramen. Everything we order was super yummy!  Definitely coming back again next time we're in town!!\nI would recommend making reservations next time, the sushi bar is kind of tight and if you order a good amount of food, not too much room.","323":"Danielle was the perfect server - always smiling and came around enough but not too much, made good suggestions and generally let us be silly, nearby table neighbors were great, food was fresh and tasty. I had the crab topped chicken which was juicy and flavorful. The man had ravioli something that was also tasty - fresh pasta and good meat sauce. \n\nThe salad and soup and breadsticks are always wonderful. We also got the bruschetta which was really perfect - not specialty, not gourmet, just perfectly normal, fresh tasting tomato, basil and olive oil yumminess.\n\nWe also had a trio of their Dolcini desserts which made it perfect so we could have tiramisu and the limoncello and strawberry stuff!\n\nOverall, even though it was really busy and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table (although 'waiting' in the bar having a drink hardly counts as waiting), with the excellent service and great food this place definitely gets 5 stars from me and for a chain restaurant that is definitely something!","324":"I'm truly disgusted by the service of this restaurant.  I came in with my family (Mom and Dad) and they said 10 minute wait, we said okay, we notice that they were short with their staff so we waited patiently till we were seated at a table, but that 10 minutes turned into a 30min wait. So the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait, after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn't exist, the hostess later seated another table which were 4 Caucasian customers, we were still patiently waited for around another 30min, when those 4 sat down an Asian waiter quickly came to take their order, I got the waiters attention and said excuse me, we came here first. And she made up an excuse saying how \"Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy\" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say \"Oh but they serve the people who come before\" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table\" she said it depends. So in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well, called Rice Paper.","326":"These are sooo good!  I'm having Bulgogi dog cravings right now!  So tasty!  Want to go back and try the carne asada fries too!  See you soon!","329":"This is such a great attraction!!! My 13 year old son loves all things Marvel - it made the highlight of our trip! Staff are very helpful and the venue makes you feel like you are in the middle of the movie!","330":"My family and I visited and decided to take some pictures with the green screen so they can edit in the Avengers in them afterwards. Since this was our first time visiting this place, the staff was very patient and helped guide us. When we went to go check out which ones to print, Agent Collins was a great help. We loved his easy going personality and he has great customer service! 10\/10 would visit again. The pics came out very nice too! Thank you, Agent Collins. Continue to show your awesome personality and great customer service! Very much appreciated.","337":"The food here is the best Greek food I've had in Arizona. The prices aren't too bad and the service was great. They are really fast too!!","338":"This Pita Jungle is located in the food court at the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. Out of all the eateries in the food court, this is by far and away the healthiest. There are some vegetarian and vegan options for those looking for a meat-free dish. The lentil soup is super yum and they have some great dishes I haven't seen anywhere else. They have several locations in the valley. The one on Ray and Dobson has a patio right next to a small lake. It's a great location, but can get crazy busy, especially during lunch on the weekends or on gorgeous days.","342":"Love coming back to this location, one of the best ones I've been to. Have tried other buffalo's and they don't top the service from the metro center store. We always get helped out by Chelsea and she is awesome always has a smile and makes us feel at home, also the team captains are always checking to see if we are good with our orders and drinks","344":"Went here as a last resort because a hose on my son's truck busted and we were stuck. \n\nThey usually ask for a 24 hour turn-around, but because we had kids in the Nevada desert heat they made the hose with clamps, etc. in about 20 minutes. Great service and the part, which no auto parts store could replicate (strangely), was done perfectly.\n\nSuper nice guys, not expensive at all, and they really saved the day. Thank you, guys, you're awesome!","348":"Mr Cool Heating and Air Conditioning came to the rescue for me on short notice AND was able to work on a swamp cooler, which many companies do not. \n\nWe have three dogs of our own and we foster dogs, so when it started to heat up here in Vegas we were worried when the swamp cooler didn't seem to be blowing out air as cold as it normally does. I started reading reviews and messaging companies on yelp to see who, if any, would work on Swamp Coolers. The answer is, very few do, and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate, and often that fee doesn't apply towards the repair cost. Mr Cool didn't charge me an estimate fee and they had Derek come out to my house the very next day. Derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like I was clueless. He offered his estimate for service and even told me I could shop around for other estimates to be certain I was getting a good price. I had already shopped around a bit so I was happy to proceed with their help. \n\nSwamp cooler parts are very large so they don't have space to keep them in their vans, but Derek assured me he could buy the parts and complete the repair the very next day. I explained that my husband and myself would need to wait until Friday when we were getting paid for repair and he was kind enough to work with us so we could come to an arrangement for payment so we wouldn't have to deal with our house being so hot. He came back the next day and was here for a good amount of time as swamp coolers take more time for repair and he was very thorough and explained everything to me again. I asked questions about how to best maintenance our swamp cooler and he was happy to answer. I'm very glad we chose Mr Cool and would HIGHLY recommend Derek as he was so patient, kind, and hardworking. Swamp coolers are a pain for repair so if they were affordable for our repair I'm sure they're even better with AC units. Thank you Derek and Mr Cool, our house gets soooo cold now, just how I like it!","349":"This place.  We are staying at the Legacy Golf Resort and that we would grab a quick bite there since we were driving by.  Such a fun atmosphere !  And, fantastic food that has a unique flare and is healthy.  I also like the casual environment where you can play outdoor games with the family. Highly recommend this spot!!!","350":"One of my favorite places to eat in town. They have the best bean dip I've ever had. The owner is so kind, and I highly recommend a margarita on the rocks and chicken tacos.","355":"I am speechless. I am without words to properly describe this place. Everything about this place is amazing. The staff, the food, everything. I ate one meal today and I made it count by getting the 2-meat plate with brisket and ribs with grits and beans as the sides. The ribs had to be my favorite, but my mind was blown by the jalape\u00c3\u00b1o cheddar grits, and then lord the brisket and beans. Oh hell, who am I kidding I can't put these in any order. Eat everything here. I don't know who Bekke is, but she's got one hell of a pecan pie named after her.","356":"The best aged angus burger fed on carrots..... the staff is awesome too.... can't wait to go back....","357":"4.5 Stars\n\nAn extra star for the legendary Iraqi fish dish known as 'Masgoof.'  If you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq.  An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.\n\nIn most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because I don't love the almighty Kabob, it's because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.\n\nThe interiors and d\u00c3\u00a9cor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I've come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  I'm glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.\n\nHats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you'll meet.","358":"I have been going to this nail salon for 8 months now.  I only go to Ahn - she is so great!  Never once has she hurt me while cutting my cuticles.  I always get gel manicure & pedicure & she does a fantastic job!!   All tools are clean & sterilized and salon is pleasant  to be in.","359":"Too much food and not good for diabetics the food is delicious.  Just had a spread of the waffle, protein omelette, veggie omelette, brioche french toast and chicken and waffles between 6 of us.  Oh left off apple pancakes.  All great and Tracee was the best waitress. She leads a great happy birthday too.","361":"Jodi the salesperson design of the layout of the cabinets was excellent.\nJayson installed the cabinets professionally. \nThe staff and materials used high quality.","362":"Wow! So fresh, ripe, and sweet! And right in my back yard! I have watched customers go in and out of this small location in the strip mall and always wanted to try this! So glad I did! Can't wait to come back and try everything else!","363":"I'm so..... Heated... I bought the 3 amigo and it was amazing.... I can't believe they'd serve me something this good","365":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. They are RUDE, unprofessional and they have personal lockers that you HAVE to put your purse in to shop with them. I was asked to go and put my purse in my car. Excuse me?! Is this even legal? Are you going to replace my purse and it's contents if someone steals my personal items? I'm not sure who is running this place but this insane policy is CLEARLY negatively impacting you business. BAD move, BAD business move. Go across the street to Sally's.","367":"Amazing. In Phoenix for the #bmophx marathon. Feet felt like I had run 26.2 miles alright this morning. Stopped by for a foot massage and these guys are amazing.\nWalked out of there feeling like I had two new feet!\nI have had foot massages all over the country and these guys are top two or three for sure!","369":"Fair pricing. Quick response. Great junk removal. Brandon gets it done.","370":"Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in ages.  The service was glacial.  I ordered a house salad, but was told not all the ingredients listed on the menu were available.  I ended up with a plate of arugula and a tomato with some not-so-tasty French dressing  We waited for over an hour for the main course to arrive--General Jackson's Chicken.  The menu promises:  \"Boneless, marinated chicken deep fried and tossed in spicy, savory sauce, served with jasmine rice, broccoli and napa\"  Spicey sauce?  This sauce was so spicy I was unable to even taste the chicken.  The rice was strictly Uncle Ben's and i saw no broccoli or napa.  We had a couple beers before the meal while waiting.. Total bill:  $55.  I'm not a tightwad, but dinner in a little strip mall restaurant should not set you back $55--or else it should be delectable.  Battiste and Dupree was not the \"hidden gem\" others had told me about.  Hope your mileage differs.","371":"Good, clean place to get a mani\/ pedi. The two came to $39 with tax and they did a great job of both. TVs all over so you can watch tv and freindly staff. \n\nWill be going back for my next mani\/pedi.\n\n**** UPDATE*****\n\nThe great manicure that I got here lasted all the way through my vacation to Mexico without  so much as a chip! This was a regular manicure and not done with shellac.\n\nOnly now, after two days back to work and polishing mad silverware, is it starting to chip. I'm upping the stars from my former 4 to 5.\n\nVery impressed and will be returning with friends :)","372":"Interior is super cool and chill & the place has numerous decorative pieces if you look carefully.\nI had Harajuku and Penicillin & they are amazing especially the penicillin. The dash of Islay really takes it to the next level.\nAll the bartender look very passionate & our main bartender Joseph was amazing.\nDef worth stopping by.","373":"Great food and have good vegetarian options. Always busy  lots of great sauces to choose from","374":"First time buyer,\nI was excited to go in buy my first car the last week of November 2014. At the beginning the owner was very nice and was giving all the details of the car I bought a Mini Cooper. Knowing that it had issues in the transmission. Witch he promised he would cover with and insurance ASC warranty a Vehicle Protection Plan within three months or 3000 miles. I contacted him several times for him to get my car fixed he kept saying that he would fix it after the holidays. January, February passed the car was not fix yet. I contacted him one las time, I told him that I would give him one more month than he told me that he has been working on it still. He told me that it was an imported part witch was not easy to find. I told him I will take legal action and he than answered with '' do whatever you have to do'' with a arrogant tone so unprofessional till now I can say that he has NEVER!!! Contacted me!!! To keep me updated or give me a solution. I believe I have been more than patient at this time it is incredible how they claim to be a legal business. I will be contacting him again and demand a solution. I highly suggest you think twice about going here. I have read another review regarding several comparable issues. I have never had this experience and it is horrible driving your first car with a bad transmission.\nI really want to warn you do not go here!!! \nI have never written a review but I really want let people know that these people are committing fraud!!!\n\n\n\nBE AWARE OF THIS LOCATION!","375":"I was very disappointed with the customer service from the server to the owner which really surprised me, what a BITCH!  I ordered a western omelet with hash browns crispy and when I got the omelet there was no cheese in it. The hash browns were barely cooked. In addition, we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, \" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy\".  But guess what none of that happened!  I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills. In addition, when paying for my food I was told that they only take cash so I had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn't sit well with me, I almost said screwed it, but my conscience said don't do it, so I went back and paid my bill.  Long story short, if you want good customer service and u want good food I would recommend going to Denny's or Bob Evans. Oh yeah one more thing, if no stars were a choice I would have put none!!!","376":"Let's just say I'm shocked. People are super friendly. have other food then donuts! It close to my work. Price isn't too bad it is reasonable. It's a great place to relax and get some work done","377":"I really enjoyed Ashley and Ami Salon. She did a great job, was friendly, and professional. I usually get my hair done when I go to MI because of the quality of the highlights and the price.  The price was very affordable, and the highlights. FANTASTIC!\n\nThanks Ashley. i highly recommend you and Ill be back.","378":"Brandy was amazing! Loved her personality and that she made all of us feel welcome at the studio! She is a great technician to boot! Highly recommend seeing this place if you're interested in great photos of your baby!","380":"WHOA!\n\nRed Carpet handles business.  No WAIT No LINES No HASSLE,  seriously though.  Why worry about lines in Vegas when you can pregame in the room and immediately step into the club?!?!  \n\nI'd give them a million stars.\n\nWalked into XS -no problem-       9 dudes\nWalked into EBC- no problem-    9 dudes\nCrazy huge 30 passenger limo- GMC Kodiak or something-   Ridiculous\n\nCouldn't have made my bachelor party better.  I will be using them again and again for as long as I live when I come to Vegas.  All their staff is great with email or phone correspondence, thank you Annie!!\n\nYou cannot go wrong with them.  Shell out the extra dough and book your Vegas clubbing experience, you wont be disappointed.","382":"These guys literally saved me.  I had a RFP due during the holidays.  With my computer and printer crashing, I was in a serious bind.   I usually go to Staples Printing Centers-- but, they couldn't get it done in time.   So, I got on the Peoria Chamber website and International Minute Press\/Desert Sky Printing came to the rescue.  They finished my printing and the RFP was turned in with 1 hour to spare.  I recommend them highly!","384":"I am never disappointed with this place. I've yet to eat at the restaurant but the ahi bar is amazing! I always come in to get the spicy ahi bowl and a few sides of ahi. So yummy!","385":"A must go destination in Phoenix.\nChinese - Mexican - Jamaican Fusion Fast Casual (or as I like to call it - Confusion!)\nIt's a Phoenix original.  It's been on Diner's Dives and Drive Ins.\n\nIf it's your first time, go up to the counter (to the left of the cash registers) and ask for the orientation - they'll walk you through the ordering process, and give you samples of several of the dishes.  After you do that, grab an order form and pick a 2 item combo and choose 7 9 Black and White.  That's all your really need to know.  :-)  That's Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Black Beans and White Rice.  Jade Red Chicken is sort of their take on sweet and sour, but with a spicy twist.  Jerk Chicken is Jamaican influenced (and can be quite spicy some days).  The Black Beans are amazing - stir them into your rice (easier to eat both with your chopsticks when you do this).  And, did I mention, you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  Yep!  Best snickerdoodles around, and one comes with every dish!\n\nIf you haven't been to Chino's - it's time - make a run for the border\/great wall\/beach!\n(and make sure to read the non-PC T-shirts while you wait - funny!)","386":"I think when the first people I encountered was courteous and friendly then the critic inside of me melts a little, the front desk was very helpful and friendly, the therapies were excellent.  I even decided to join their wellness program because it's very accommodating and manageable for my expenses.","387":"Terry (the owner) has been fixing my car for years and has done consistently great work. I completely trust his opinion when he tells me what he thinks is wrong or what the course of action should be. I have seen many of his projects over the years in many different stages of completion and they always look and run superbly. The shop itself is always full of cars from all different decades in for all different types of work, and the reception area is all made up in a tiki-type theme so when you visit you will definitely have something cool to look at while you wait. I would recommend this shop to anyone with an old car that needs fixing, whether that means getting an oil change or having major restoration work done.","388":"This is one of my favorite places to eat.  The food is delicious, fresh and almost everything can be made with tofu as a substitute.  The owners are very friendly and the food truly is superb!","389":"We were recommended this Vet by a friend who has gone to him for years; and we are not disappointed.\n\nDoctor Youssef first helped my boyfriend when his cat had a horrible hairball stuck in her stomach. He shows so much compassion and understanding for animals it is hard not to believe he truly cares for their well being.\n\nHe is not afraid to tell you if you are harming your pet. If they are overweight, he will tell you straight up and let you know you are causing them harm. If you are an uptight suburbian, then don't go to him. He will tell you that you are killing your dog feeding them 'Puppocinos'. Which you are.\n\nI started taking my dog here after she expressed her hatred of her previous vet, who felt that it was 'no big deal' and that they could always just muzzle her or sedate her for check ups. I felt that was ridiculous and brought her to Doctor Youssef who felt the same and is doing everything in his power to make her comfortable with him and his staff. He has even let me take her around the whole building just to get use to it. \n\nHis prices are very fair, and he himself is the most trustworthy vet I have yet to meet. One conversation with him and you can tell he does not care about money, he is truly one of the very few who are in this business just because they care about animals.\n\nI love this guy so much I recommended him to my best friend when she got her cat, and she takes it to him as well. She got the cat spayed and he offered to keep it overnight for free!\n\nIt is a drive away for me, but is well worth it. I would drive to Boulder City if I had to just to keep this guy as my vet.","393":"I've been a happy client for several years! Ashlee takes time and ultimate care to do an outstanding job every time. I receive tons of compliments on my lashes and how natural they look. Ashley is a true lash artist. I'm 100% satisfied every time!","394":"I LOVE THEIR CHICKEN STREET TACOS!!!  Btw this Rubio is inside the Monte Carlo ( MGM Resorts employees like Aria,Vdara,Luxor,Mirage etc..) gets 15% off just show your employees I.d.","396":"Brandi is awesome... love her demeanor and personality. She is an excellent stylist.. I am also a cosmetologist so I know  the real deal when I see one! I will be back again for sure! Her scalp message was perfection.. so relaxing and I had a blast talking \"shop\" with her. Highly recommend this lady!","397":"Chad installed a new heavy door for me which required modification and specialized hardware. His work was excellent and precise and completed sooner than expected. He was very polite, knowledgeable, and trustworthy. I will definitely offer all my future work to him and have already recommended him to my friends.","398":"To start, its a beautiful venue. Definitely a hidden gem in the GTA. But please be very very careful and get everything in writing. George Christakis the co-owner of this venue and manager of Crystal Fountain is very devious and sketchy. \n\nWe had checked out a few venues, one being Crystal Fountain, where we met George. He was definitely rude, and lacked professionalism. We left with a very bad impression.\n\nFast forward a few week, and we spotted Estate banquet, we emailed and arranged to meet up. We showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen, having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us. The venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details. My girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of George, whom I later found out when I asked is indeed the same George from Crystal Fountain.\n\nWe called George the next day to discuss food options, and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed. Tasting was included for 6 people. I asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone. When the email arrived it simply had generics such as \"assorted veggies, assorted cakes, hors d'oeuvres\" as well as a tasting for 2 people. As well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price.\n\nWhen we called back to discuss, he verbally told us again what it would include, but when I asked him to email us specifics, he refused. In a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field, and he does not give specifics. That grilled veggies, will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives, almost a year later. That it's his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide. \n\nNeedless to say, I told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying, we would be walking away. He said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing, and that we were to trust him. We walked.\n\nPlease be very wary of this George, he is very unscrupulous. The venue itself it nice, and private, but no way was I going to ruin such a special day by getting involved with such shady business dealings.","399":"I bought a house that had a safe with a dial.type lock which while definitely secure is a bit slow to open and makes me want to use the safe less often. I did have a business card from The Safe Keeper attached to opening instructions that was left by the seller. I went online, found their website and emailed them regarding changing to an electronic lock. They replied in the affirmative the next morning. I called and scheduled the work which was done within two days of my first contact. The service technician, Vid, was on time, knowledgeable, very personable and completed the changeover in the timeframe he had quoted even while explaining everything about the safe, the locking mechanism and answering all my questions.\nThis was a great experience with a top notch company. I couldn't be more pleased.","405":"I had a Engine in warranty from LKQ, these guys were to install its replacement.. They told me done in a few days, ok...   I went there and noticed when the engine was taken out they carelessly left my AC dangling and did not remove it to install new engine. No big deal till you understand the rest.. this is a cheap way to not refill system and do it right...  After going to get my car when they said it was done I Notice AC didn't work and wrong Coolant added to Radiator. ( cannot use regular Green... Yellow Ford required ) Then I say I will come get it when they fix the AC, they tell me hours later its the PCM..( Computer ) well OK you guys shorted it out, the only thing wrong was a Valve Rattle, now this?? After 2 days with LKQ saying they are going to send a inspector I drove past and noticed my Mirrors Loose (broken ) on BOTH SIDES!! I am ANAL when it comes to my car I bought New in 2007..  this was enough, I took it home.. I had enough...  They forgot 4 bolts, 2 in wrong spot, One Digging into Power Steering Rack, Power steering Bottle Cracked on Bottom from a Poor removal and hid the fact it was cracked on the lower nipple and the AC system they claimed did not hold R-134a because they DID remove the AC later and LOST the O-Rings when they filled it, it leaked.. and they SHORTED the AC Protective Diode.. IT WAS NOT THE PCM.. this place MIGHT be good for a Oil Change if you tell them how to do it, but that's all..  Telling me How Do we know you didn't bring it in here like this... BAHAHAHA, a back yard weekend mechanic was able to figure out they were unskilled for the task.. I will make sure with a HUGE online review on EVERY Review site that this place is NOT the place to take a Car... or a peddle bike for that matter..\n\nI replaced the o-rings, pulled the diode and got the ac working after I vacuumed it and refilled, what armatures..  I guess I got to go to ford, spend $80 on a new Power steering Bottle and tell LKQ to send me the money..\n\nWhen they first got my car knowing it was under warranty from LKQ they tried to get me to pay them the other $45 per hour on top of the $55 an hour they were getting under warranty... I told them do not touch it until I contact LKQ, they tried to scam me out of $45 an hour x12 hours.... I am not stupid..  LKQ should have pulled it out right there and then, but no.. they agreed to do it for the $55 an hour, but the skill these guys have isn't worth Minimum wage..","407":"Cannot praise this place enough!!  If there were 10 stars, I'd give them a 10 star rating.  I called them about some custom lighting I needed for my handicap van and they scheduled an appointment for me to come in and see Jay for advisement.  The service was impeccable, the pricing was reasonable, and they were honest.  I plan to go back for some other custom work and will be letting everyone I know what a great place this is to deal with.  It's a nice relief when you find a great business when there are so many questionable businesses these days.  Highly recommend!!","408":"I placed a large takeout order (almost $100) late on a Thursday night and the gentleman made me repeat every part of the order at least twice. He didn't even bother to tell me what time the order would be ready. I frequent this place for lunch and use them for work events pretty frequently and have always had a decent experience but not this time.\n\nWhen I got home and went to unpack the food, I realized the order was completely wrong. Checked the receipt and the order that was rung in was completely different then what I asked for and with totally different quantities. It was as if the order was erased and the guy just tried to make it up out of memory. Certainly was not please to have ordered mainly calzones and end up with almost all subs.\n\nThe most annoying part of the experience is the sausage, pepper and onion subs were 85% peppers and onions. There was about 10 slices of very very thin sausage on the entire sandwhich which I think is a ripoff for $8.99. Terrible experience overall and will highly make me reconsider ever going here again.","409":"Authentic and Rustic full of ambiance.. Great for families aswell as romantic dinners.. Ahhh the memories","411":"New to Calgary, we did our homework on line and settled for Capo for one of our first meals out. Did not disappoint! A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as \"butter\" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates!\nThe end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came. What a gem of an eatery if you can afford to splurge now and then! A highlight of my week and would recommend to anyone!","412":"Never had Belizean food or have heard of them and they're right in front of my building for 7 months. Finally made my way over there and it's so dang good! Chicken fell off the bone. I ordered tamales since it's the special right now and it's huge for $5.50! Why did I wait so long! I was skeptical at first didn't know what to expect. Owners are super nice.","413":"Fajitas on Fire.  5 beers in a bucket for $15. Good chips and Salsa.  Mariachi Band.  Strategic TV's for all seats.  Excellent Margaritas. Kid friendly. This place rocks!!!\n\nOut of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food, drinks, and music, we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!  \n\nWe arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!  \n\nWe met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!\n\nThe Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!  \n\nThis is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!","414":"Drive-thru style smog station conveniently located close to the DMV.  I had a bit of trouble finding it via google maps- it's behind the 7-11 across the street from Smith's. Super quick service, I was done in about 5 minutes. 10\/10 would recommend.","415":"Over priced nasty nachos. The meat was so salty I couldn't eat them. And they tried to sell me a regular bottled water for $7. I will never go to this place again!!! This place sucks!!","417":"Was amazing the first visit (when corporate was still overseeing their operations during the first few weeks of opening). The second visit was horrible.  We won't be returning. The salads were watery and tasteless, the fries were old burnt and overseasoned, the restaurant was dirty and the tables sticky, and the staff was impatient and unprofessional.","419":"Unfortunately, I don't understand the negative reviews, maybe it was bad timing? But I LOVED the crazy burger. I brought my American friend and he had the Green burger, and was impressed about how good it was. SUPER friendly staff, they made sure I had every condiment (ketchup, napkins etc.) I didn't expect any service at all from a burger joint but it was an pleasant addition. I'll be coming back for the food and the exceptional service. I've never had such a nice experience at a burger joint before. I'd recommend the Crazy Burger combo (Onion rings and Boylan's Black Cherry Soda). Although it was a bit messy it was delicious, and I loved every single bite of it. I'll definitely be coming back soon.","420":"Listen people this is the spot. Stop paying too much at over priced place where the portions are small and mash potatoes are green. This place portion size it meant to feed a horse not a mouse like the other places. Like I'm coming back here over and over again. Plus my gf lives not far is its convenient.","422":"I really like this bookstore for its DVD and music selections. There's a nice clearance section with top end DVDs going for only two dollars. The staff here is very pleasant, and it's clean and well organized. I can't speak for their book section, as I have yet to shop for books here. They also have gadgets, which is nice. It's easy to find parking outside. My one complaint, if any, would be that they apparently don't check for the regions of their DVDs. I've purchased several which weren't made for the US region, so it was a total waste of money. Overall, I really like shopping here, and I'd recommend it to anyone who asked.","423":"third time I have had my eyelashes done, good service, awesome staff, reasonable prices...highly recommend!","424":"Terrible customer service , overprice , only one mechanic at the shop , 3 weeks to fix my bike ; owner dale kieffer so rude I never come back again.... Yamaha dealer same price excellent service","427":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. We have had issues here before with being seated (it took them 15 minutes when the place was empty one time), but tonight takes the cake. \n     We went to get food at 2am, pulled into the drive thru at 2:32. We waited there for 15 minutes, then we got trapped in the drive thru by a curb and other vehicles for 25 more minutes. I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in. \n     I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave. All he said is \"I don't know if they shut down the drive thru but I can take your order here.\" Like THAT DOESNT HELP US. We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.\n     After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are \"backed up inside\", but they weren't at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing. I yelled \"are you getting paid for this?\" Through the speaker and he had time to answer and tell me to CALM DOWN but couldn't take my damn order.\n     We finally left with out even PLACING an order after 49 minutes. Will not return and by the other reviews for this place, I should have checked yelp before ever coming here in the first place. Went to the Mentor one after and got served right away.","428":"Decided on Valley ENT because my insurance provider covered them and they were conveniently located. I needed a quick appointment and didn't want to wait several weeks. I took a gamble and picked first available, which was Dr. Chuang. After I made my appointment, I began reading reviews on Valley ENT and Dr. Chuang. I couldn't have disagreed more on the negative reviews. Both Valley ENT and Dr. Chuang were professional, courteous, thorough and friendly. I will enthusiastically recommend both to anyone looking for quality healthcare. I strongly endorse them. They were excellent.","431":"I didn't listen to the low reviews, I wish I did. Literally the worst. We went through two of their routers that both broke. One didn't get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for, I called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router. Finally got the replacement and things seemed okay, but no, it completely broke in less than a month. It won't even turn on anymore. They suggested we go buy a new router from Best Buy, who btw doesn't sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? They charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn't work properly! Every time you chat with them you get different answers and they transfer you to about 10 people before they even get close to answering your question. \nDo not use this service, it might be cheaper but not cheap enough to deal with all this BS they put you though.","433":"Below average food. The service can be spotty, depending on the time of day.\n\nJust..look elsehwere. I'm surprised they are still in business.","434":"Paco's Tacos is the real deal! In spite of the great Yelp reviews, I still had my reservations about eating at another TexMex chain. How good could it be I thought? Well they totally nailed it, from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!\n\nThe dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch. Adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu. I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice, mixed cabbage coleslaw and, their own, Charro style pintos, all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic. \n\nPremeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately. The chips are very thin and were very fresh. The place was clean and attractive. Sanitation rating was a 95. For those long time Charlotteans like myself, you may remember this place as the old Manzetti's.\n\nI'm going back soon! This place is a Gotta Try!.","438":"i did not stay at this hotel but i did visit the hotel and the shops. Beautiful place!!!! not too crowded, very quiet and peaceful... I love this place. This hotel is located on the strip on the north end.. It's less crowded on the north and there is a mall right across the street. This hotel has many high end stores for shopping such as LV, Cartier, etc, but there is a regular mall across the street with Macy's, forever 21, etc..  The gondola rides are nice, but short!! it's 19.95 a person and it's 10mins long. They can stay in doors and out doors with the gondola. I heard out door is better at night because of the lights. Great overall experience, wonderful restaurants, awesome shops..","440":"Excellent service quality.. I bought my car here and this is my car's first oil change service. They are very professional. I definitely recommend this place.  Since I bought my car here, they did everything free for first time. I checked the receipt and the prices are decent when compared to other auto service centres.","443":"Lovely food. I am also happy to eat at this location of paradise bakery.. they have fresh ingredients and make good alterations if asked for. Great for vegetarians and well as non vegetarians.\nFact that this location is in tempe marketplace, makes a high difference so we can enjoy outdoor seating in evenings.","446":"I had two different experiences with Carpet Monkey. In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also, they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs, hallway, stairs, and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09\/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09\/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09\/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn't satisfied at all with Mark's work. He said he'll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09\/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he's on his way, again great communication. I didn't worry too much that it wasn't Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn't expecting. There were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn't do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze. Thank you Isaac and Rick!","447":"Mike and his crew did a very good job on our backyard waterfall. I waterfall is about 20 years old and had a lot of cracks and was leaking water. We also had part of a palm tree growing out of the stonework. He was very knowledgeable and experienced. Prompt to the minute! And we felt he did a very good job with his crew. He was on site most of the time for the job and  would highly recommend using again.","449":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Surprise, which isn't very hard to do because surprise is full of nasty chain restaurants. However, if you want to eat some darn good vietnamese food, this is the place. The pho of any type is amazing, even to go. Also try the spring rolls. Make sure you wrap them in the lettuce with a bit of mint, the texture is bomb fool! It gets a little crowded around 6pm because all of Sun City eats dinner around that time. So show up around 7pm and you'll be fine.","451":"Great steak. Great service. Cool venue. Although it's died down a bit, this place is still always on my radar for good food.","452":"Oh my gosh.. BOMBBBBBBBB!!! This place is so amazing!! The food is incredible! I have had almost everything on the menu. They have milk shake happy hour every day between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. with half price milkshakes. The first time you go in, tell them its your first time and they will give you a sample of all of their different sauces. My two favorite are sweet heat and creamy garlic. The staff is incredibly friendly and personable. The restaurant is clean and the hand washing station is pretty neat. Go check it out you will not be disappointed!","453":"I have eaten at Pan Asian about 15+ times, and have taken several friends here. \n\nI give it 5 stars because the food is insanely good. How anyone can give the food less than 5 stars is beyond me. I am a food critic and have eaten at hundreds of restaurants. Pan Asian is up there of one of my all time favorites. How anyone can give this place less than 4 stars is beyond me. There are always going to be those negative nellys that only look for what they can complain about. \n\nI give the space and decor 4\/5 stars - it is small and decor is minimal, but it works. \n\nMiso Soup, Massaman Curry, Basil Fried Rice, and a Thai Iced Tea  is my fav at the moment and what I wish I was eating right now...","454":"Had the soup and sandwich.  Wow, it was great.  I can't wait to return.","455":"If you can avoid this company, I recommend you do so. They are in the midst of overcharging me $100 for nothing, and insist I have to prove I don't owe it by going to their inconveniently located offices. They won't take a letter or FAX. Rude on the phone to me.  You have to watch them every month, as we have had other bills that were inaccurate (overbilling us) before, too. NO, I do not recommend.","456":"I've waited 16 years to get this crazy rachet home tattoo covered up I'm celebrating 10!yrs of marriage and had to get this handled. It had scarring it was bad!! Josh came through like a champ his superrrr cool it was a longgg session but I took it like a G and now I'll be in the Domican Republic celebrating without having to worry about my back.\nMy tattoo looks amazing doesn't look like a cover up but most important for who ever is reading this... Your in BOMB professional hands the vibe is comfortable and the people are chill. God bless you and I'll be sending you lots of people Thank you Josh!!!!!!!!!!","458":"Dismal, lukewarm, defrosted-tasting \"TexMex\" glop;\n\nMumbly, unengaged waiter;\n\nClueless manager, who seeing us with barely nibbled entrees\non plates shoved forward for pickup, thanked us\nperfunctorily for our patronage;\n\nWe're from the Texas Hill Country;\ndown there, we jail critters \nwho serve up grub this bad,\nfor their own protection.\n\nNever, never, NEVER again\n(Back to Yard House for real food)","460":"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before\/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.\n\nI ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.\n\nI also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. \n\nThey brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.\n\nYes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique, delicious restaurant.","462":"Best fried pickles in town! Great prices, fabulous and friendly staff. Zero complaints.","464":"Great customer service! Lisa and Marie were a big help with deciding what I needed. With so many places to choose from it's great to find a national level business treat you like new neighbors.","466":"Awesome smoke shop! Can't say any bad things about this place. The son and dad are really nice and provide great customer service. I always come here for my hookah flavor and coal and will continue to do so!","468":"Amazing Burgers. The combinations of ingredients is Fantabulous  \nIt's difficult to have a favorite and yes, I've had every item on the menu","469":"OK, this buffet is pricey.  Something in the neighborhood of $48 i think, but if you go to the Tix4Tonight or similar vendors you can buy a voucher for $2 that gets you into the buffet for $33 and change, so a total of $35... a $10 savings. A bottle of OK wine is 12 bucks and this becomes a really fun evening. Some complain that the food isn't prepared like some 5 star restaurant, but guess what... This isn't a 5 star restaurant... it's a decent buffet where you can try a little or a lot of everything. It's just fun, and a lot cheaper than those fancy chef name places in the hotels. Oysters,  crab, all kinds of fish and shellfish and lobsters. They have all of this and lots of veges and other dishes. I really like the dessert selection but admittedly,  when I am full of wine, crab, scallops and oysters the deserts start looking less attractive. Food critics, say what you like... the restaurant that fills up nightly for years and years is doing something that real people like! Don't forget to hit the half price ticket place for your discount vouchers before you go!","476":"Don't go here. Especially not for a full hour table massage. I've never tried the chair massages so I can't speak to those, but the table massage was not a great experience. I'll spare the details, but I definitely don't recommend this place.","477":"Great location; convenient to the light rail and apartment complexes.  Sea salt chocolate is my new favorite.  Will be back for other flavors!","478":"Been going here since summer, i am so glad i have discovered this jem! This joint beats any other sushi spot, even though its an izakaya. The menu is extensive. My faves are obviously tsuki don(a must try!) which no other place has, grilled squid that is cooked to perfection which is also rare nowadays, sashimi salad is to die for, and tamaguro roll with red tuna, tomatoes and garlic sauce. I mean everything else that Iv tried here is also delicious. Their lunch boxes are of a great value.The place has great ambience and music, service is always very consistent. This place is good for a quick lunch, big party or nice dinner. Its simply a spot to-go-to! Can't wait to go back!","479":"Love love love Kelly's!   I just discovered this spot while I was doing The Taste of Scottsdale tour.  We stopped there for dessert.  The restaurant gives you the feel of an elegant Irish pub.  They have a pool table, dart board, putting green and HUGE patio!  In the past, I always thought of Kelly's as a bar or late night hang out (which is not really my thing) but I was very wrong!  Their menu looked amazing!  They have an \"award winning\" four cut burger--which I will try next time!  Dessert was delish!  We had the doughnut holes and Kelly's twinkie.  Both were excellent! \n\nI was most impressed with the service!  We were greeted right away.  While we were eating our dessert both a manager and the chef stopped by to check on us.  I was most impressed that the chef and manager cared so much about our experience!  A+ service!  I'm glad I found this new gem in Old Town Scottsdale!  \n\nI can't wait to go back to Kelly's!","480":"Where do I start!? Came here for the first time today and was a little shocked at the prices; we were already sitting down with our two little ones and they were hungry so we weren't going to try and look for another place to eat. We ordered the fried pickles to start with, and wow! I could not believe the size of these things! Shortly after we got our meals, and once again the portions were huge! I finally understood why things were priced the way they were. Everything was sooo good; we will definitely eat here again!","481":"I was in Mesa for the morning and found this gem. I was greeted with a big smile and friendly service. The almond latte was really good, like REALLY good! If I lived in Mesa, I'd be a regular for the friendliness, good coffee, and really nice environment. It was busy, but nice and quiet - a feature that seems a bit rare in my experience. If I need coffee in Mesa again, this will be my go to place.","485":"Very impressed. Jim from Dodge plumbing came out today and presented a very rational and logical argument for why his company should not take my money to convert over to an electric tank-less water heater due to out current logistics and electrical set up and why instead we should forgo this and stick with a gas system to save us money.\nThough they could have gone along with the estimate and soaked us for some money it was nice to get some honest feedback and Jim seems to have a great deal of varied construction experience to give just that.","487":"I made a yelp account just so I could write this review, that's how rude the staff is here! The first time I came here I thought maybe it was just a one time thing. But they are consistently, unfailingly, disrespectful. I will never in my life come back here again.","488":"As a resident of Mountains Edge, its obvious we are missing the necessities....Trader Joe's (I'll even settle for a Sprouts), Costco or a NICE big gym...BUT what we do have is this place!!  Barking Dogs is the only place I buy my dog, Phoebe's food and get her groomed. Phoebs is even on a first name basis in this local gem. Staff is very knowledgeable about all things DOGS!!  They love your baby as much as you love them. Its literally less than a mile from my casa.  Yes, my pup and I are lucky and even spoiled with its location.  Be jealous.  Be very jealous. ;)","490":"Guarantee you will leave with a full and happy tummy. Not only is the good great, the customer service here is amazing. Can't beat their complementary bean dip and salsa! Food is always fresh and never disappointing. Fajitas are always a good choice and when you order the fresh guac, they'll prepare it at your table! It's like dinner and a show! Will definitely be back whenever I'm in town!","494":"Please do not eat at this place, I'm scared of this food. The worst part is the service and the trashy, anti-family, anti-american atmosphere. Please stay away","495":"Troy did my recessed lighting back in January, and he did an AMAZING job. Our home was a struggle, since our ceilings were about 16-17ft high, and he got the job done, fast, easy, and it was beautiful. Great experience.","497":"After a spontaneous visit to Piccadilly, I am sold on their artisan organic froyo (with vegan options!) I was skeptical, which is why I held out for so long on a visit...but I was very pleased with the overall experience.\n\nThe decor is trendy and interesting, it's Cleveland-centric, and they offer great vegan options. When our group entered the store, we were warmly welcomed and given an explanation of how everything worked. It's a per-ounce froyo place with lots of possibilities. I chose the artisan organic tart yogurt and the vegan blueberry...mmm. One thing to note is that because it's vegan (made with coconut milk), it's not as creamy and melts a bit quicker if you're not used to vegan things. Yum. \n\nThey have lots of topping options, along with organic MOCHI and tons of fruit. They also have nutella and flavored bubbles! I usually go with the mochi and fruit with froyo, and all of it was very fresh.\n\nIt turned out to be a bit pricy, but I'm willing to pay for it - the whole thing, from the froyo to the overall experience.","498":"This place is the best. My friends and I get takeout from here all the time, and it's great because I can exercise my total indecision right up to choosing food, because they have sooooooo many choices. Thai? Vietnamese? Chinese? Sushi? Tottie's has it all, and it is ALL delicious. Sugar Cane Chicken? Pho? Pad Thai? What are you in the mood for!? The prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are decent, not overwhelming, but everything is flavorful and distinctive.","501":"I booked a session and decided to also use my coupon for free Easter collage. The girl told me it would take 45 min to print. Showed up 45min later and I guess they were having issues formatting it to print out correctly. Hour and a half total spent waiting and the guy kept saying if you wait I'll give a free print. I had already waited hour and a half along with session time and a five month old wasn't going to deal with it much longer. I don't travel to chandler often and live 30min from this location. I told them they needed to mail it to me and I left furious. Never again!\n\nUpdate: The area manager did contact me and had my missing photos mailed and also had one of them framed for me.","502":"Holy \"Made fresh at your table\" Guacamole!!!  My heart skips a beat just thinking about it.  Tex-Mex fine dining... at it's finest.\nAlso an important note:  One of my top five places to drink a house margarita.","503":"As a long-time fan of Chick-fil-A, I wasn't walking in expecting to be comparing the two. But as we ordered, sat down, and were served, I couldn't help it. The service is as good, if not better here than at CFA. The sauces are better, and so is the chicken! Everything was very clean and we were thoroughly impressed. I would like more sandwich options--I think next time I'll just be getting chicken strips because I ended up eating just the chicken off my pimento crunch sandwich. Very impressed!!!","504":"Came here on a whim to try it out with my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e and we were not impressed at all. Ordered the street corn queso and it was super lacking on flavor and also pulled a large chunk of butter from it. Tried to save it a little with the sauce tray and even added salsa to it and still wasn't there. My Sonoran dog looked like it was from the previous day... typical dry wrinkled no snap day-old dog, the brioche bun was soggy from too much butter. And the tacos were cold. We Couldn't even finish the meal. The salsa was the only highlight of the lunch. Also watched a server shatter a glass over the ice well and proceed to use the ice that the glass had broken into to serve a customer. I will NEVER return.","505":"Very disappointing, the price is too expensive for the food quality.   First of all, there is no green tea or red bean  ice cream on the menu.   They only have ice cream bar, and it is only one per person, on the menu, they didn't say that is limited. Secondly, way too much rice on the sushi. I guess thats how they make the money. Lastly, the ipad service is stupid. you have to wait for someone to confirm it. Overall, not a good reataurant for sushi.","507":"Great food. Try the chop its huge.friendly service and down home atmosphere.","508":"There was hair in our food and drinks - multiple times!  We had to send out food and drinks back 3 different times. \n\nWe were about 10 deep in out party.  2 booths seated directly next to each other. One table ordered chicken tacos.  The minute the server sat the plate down we noticed there was hair in it.  She took it right back.  \nOne of our Margaritas came out immediately after .. there was a long strain of hair floating on top.  The server took it right away and apologized - again.  The other table ordered nachos .. and guess what ... hair was it ... stuck in the Queso.  This time the server stood there and waited until we looked over the nachos.  We both noticed the hair.  He said WOW!  You guys see it's not my hair (he had a short brown cut with a cap on).   He again, returned the nachos and we decided not to order anything else.  \n\nI'll never return!","509":"They worry about their therapist but not their customers. I've been going on here for awhile and one time I missed and forgot about my appointment they charged me $60. They said that's the least they charge. Normally it's full price of your service. If it was so important not to miss an appointment why don't they give an automated text reminder within 1-2 hours of appointment like other places???","510":"Great place for a smaller breakfast, and pretty great coffee as well.","511":"So idk why ppl are giving this place such a hard time. I'm reviewing for EDC weekend. We checked in Thursday (the 20th). The guy up front gave me great service. \nIf you're looking for a place just to crash it's not bad. Nice location. Mid strip. Kinda hidden though. It was a bit hard to get ppl to find us haha.\nDon't expect a hot tub or something fancy. Like I said, just a place to crash.","512":"The most important thing for a restaurant is food safety and clean. See what I got from my dish. Other bugs maybe still forgivable. But cockroach means this restaurant is really dirty nasty and not take their kitchen clean job seriously.","515":"Best barbecue this side of the Mississippi!!!! Come here your car washed and detailed pick up some Petroleum, and slap your lips around the best barbecue you've had in Arizona!!! Hot diggity !!!","516":"Great and fresh food (had filet mignon and asparagus), quick and friendly service, and warm atmosphere are the reasons for my 5 star rating.  They were very busy for 9pm on a Tuesday night so the locals love it.  The bar area is good for dining too.  TV's with Baseball playoffs were good for entertainment.","517":"This is my very first bike! JT was very helpful along with his staff! Very friendly and they really take their time to help you and find what you need! I was there for a really long time but i never got the feeling that i was an annoyance. They really take go out of their way to make sure you get all the answers to make an informed decision. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend coming here!","519":"To whomever owns Lucki Thai:   Lucki is actually spelled with a y.   Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.\n\nI've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.\n\nI've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.  \n\nOf the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.   \n\nThe only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.\n\nI have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?\n\nBut alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist.","520":"Do not use. Should be call Unreliable towing service. Never showed up. Kept saying they were minutes away","522":"Yum! I could eat it every day. My favorite is the \"special\" burro.  My second would have to be the two tacos. Beef or chicken, both delicious. Affordable, quick, and take some tortillas home for later.","524":"This is one of the best \"hole in the wall\" spots I've been to in years! Fresh home-made tortillas, great steak, people are amazing! I came with a party of 10 ppl and the food was fast, delicious and prefer was perfect. I will definitely be back!","525":"Their specialty dishes are very unique.  The spicy tuna nachos are amazing. Some of my favorites are: lemon roll and the edamame is a must.  For desert also try the chocolate chip cookie with fudge and vanilla ice cream - yummy\nWe celebrated a birthday in the Tatami room.  Beautiful private room, we sat on cushions  in a very cozy setting.","526":"Wow! What a great sub. All of them are fantastic.I especially like the rosemary bun. The staff are alway great too and  have a up beat and positive attitude. Perfect for a quick lunch.","527":"I was sent to Vision Source South Hills for a second opinion. I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient\/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: \"patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance\". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service. While I feel Dr. Strain is a highly qualified ophthalmologist, I am exceedingly disappointed in the professionalism and efficiency of the office staff. At this point, I do not see myself returning in the future.","528":"I've had their \"Cleveland's\" breakfast many times and it is perfect every time. The best eggs and sausage breakfast in town. I don't know how they do it, but their scrambled eggs are the best I've ever had. I've tried to duplicate it at home without success. I get the same thing every time I go. Scrambled eggs with sausage, potatoes and toast with a side of Guinness. Yum!","530":"Alway stop when we're in town. Amazing fresh food. Really good prices. Friendly  service.  Drink menu has a good variety as well.","531":"I'm from LA and been looking for an awesome cut here in Vegas. I got that here from Favio. He took his time and gave me EXACTLY what I wanted. I'll definitely be back!","532":"It's awesome here!!The guys are soooo hot and nice!!The host London is amazing at the mic and getting the crowd excited!!highly recommend this place!!","535":"Two thumbs up!!!!\n\nPho (soup) and their Banh Minhs (sandwiches) are to die for!!! Not to mention their Chinese Food choices!!!! This place is a hole in the wall but their food choices are awesome!!!\n\nLocated 5 miles from the airport, no traffic, parking is not a problem either!!!!\n\nThe staff are courteous and gets your order right!!!","536":"Fresher noodles you may not find in this town, I tried the steamed vegetable dumplings and the chicken noodle soup - loved it! But careful the portions are big but the staff box it nicely and it still that's great next day :)\nAlso the mango bubble tea was tasty.","537":"The draft beer selection is great the tapas style menu is a perfect match and the upstairs is a great after work gathering place. But the best thing about this place is the bartender named Siti (sp) he is one of the best in Charlotte.","538":"Excellent ramen and one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. Very small area and limited seating, so arrive early or be ready to wait. Recommend all the bowls, sake flights, and be sure to get green tea ice cream.","540":"Went to see the exhibit \"killer heels\" and was greatly surprised. The shoes that were there were breathtaking for a real show lover like me. Everything from classic Pravda to crazy lady gaga shoes. It was a great girls day on a hot day. :)","541":"Fresh and quality sashimi and great lunch time prices.  I tried it for lunch once and I am a fan, there are few quality Japanese restaurants in the city but this is amazing (even though it's Korean owned) and great value for the money.  Great decor and swift service.","542":"Great ambience and decor! And the food is delicious. Pan fried fish, street side Indian noodles, hongkong chicken are a few names to start with !","544":"After living in Tempe for several months and not finding a nail salon, I went on yelp :) and found Nancy's. The reviews looked pretty good so I decided to give it a try. Like some of the other reviews mentioned, the salon doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside everything is great. The facility is clean, but what makes the difference for me is the fact that the staff there was so friendly, and welcoming. All of the technicians were talking with the clients and there were even a few friendly group conversations between everyone in the salon. It was very comfortable! Most of the ladies in there during my appointment were regular clients and they had nothing but good things to say about the place after learning that it was my first time there. Loyal clientele is always a good sign. \nJohnny did my acrylic nails (full set) which I am totally in love with. He did a great job and was also really personable. \nanother awesome thing about this salon is that they offer a 5% discount to anyone that pays in cash! 5% isn't a lot, but it's still a pretty cool little perk. I will definitely be returning.","546":"We went here for the 1st time this evening and really enjoyed it - great ambiance, delicious food with amazing flavors, and good service. We really liked the fresh roll, spring rolls, dumplings, wild curry (good spice!), and basil chicken. They served healthy portions. Cash only & BYOB. We will definitely return!","547":"My husband and I ordered our wedding cake here. We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12\" x 12\" square and 10-12\" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8\" square base, next layer 6\" base and the top layer 4\" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4\" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1\/2\" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on.","548":"I went to Itech Customs for just a quick quote on my iphone6s screen\/ front camera crack. iTech fixed it all for $75 when Sprint was going to charge me over $150. Thank you & I will definitely be back for any issues that I have with phone repair! I'm extremely happy and impressed! I'm recommending iTech Customs to all of my friend!!","549":"We chose this place to split lunch and it was an excellent choice. Waiter was very enthusiast and funny. Had a good beer selection (mostly bottles) which was refreshing after much walking. BLT fried green tomato appetizer is a must have. We split the blue plate for our meal. Watermelon was tasty, chicken as well. Chicken wasn't anything special for me, but I am by no means a fried chicken expert. Only downfall was restaurant was a bit dark for lunch.","553":"Got a chance to check out this spot while catching up with a business contact for coffee.  The gentleman working this morning was patient in explaining their offerings .  The coffee was smooth and only needed a bit of almond milk - kudos to the cafe for having that as an available option.  \n\nI had the pleasure of enjoying the croissant, it had the right amount of flakiness and was bigger than expected.  The atmosphere was casual and laid back.  I now look forward to trying this place out later in the day.","554":"We just used Honest Air for the second time this year because they most certainly live up to their name. The first time was in the heat of the summer when water started dripping from the ceiling. Our home warranty said it would be four days (it was a Saturday, my husband was out of town and my elderly parents were staying with me) before anyone could be out to service our home so I immediately looked up local companies myself and called Honest Air at 3:30PM on a Saturday and had someone out to my house by 4PM. The gentleman that showed up was instantly able to locate the problem and solution - terrible install design by the home builders - and my dad actually was able to make the repair with the technician's directions. The service charge was more than reasonable and I was just relieved to be able to continue using the AC. We just called them out again today to check our system as the vents do not blow equally throughout the house resulting in hot spots and cool spots. The very same technician came out and looked at our system again - and again all of our issues are due to how cheaply made the house was back in 1999 - and spent about 20 minutes teaching us how to have better air flow and utilize the vents in the house wisely. He was very kind, respectful, and clean. Whenever we need our AC or furnace repaired, replaced, or even just checked up on we will always be using Honest Air.","555":"Gorgeous hotel! I felt like a VIP. Definitely the next best thing to the real Venice, in my opinion. Lots of pools to choose from and great casino. Convenient location- close to everything. Would definitely go there again.","556":"Yes! As good as it gets in way of pinball machines! My parents and I had so much fun crossing this one off the bucket list. Plus we each got to take a walk down memory lane looking at all the machines. We loved how each machine told the history, year, etc. Keep up the good work pinballers!","557":"Besides this Walmart being ghetto they are inconsistent. They charged about 15\/16 dollars more on my oil changed","558":"Came here for lunch. It's  16.99 per person and that includes drinks. Huge selection, flavorful, and not your typical buffet. Great place!","559":"Scheduled a spa day for ourselves while we were on vacation beautiful cozy robes access to steam room sauna and jacuzzi enjoyed a hot stone massage with aromatherapy and foot soak from beginning to end so wonderfully relaxing able to also use a nice shower to finish my visit highly recommended","560":"They always greet everyone with a smile who enters even when super busy. They have excellent customer service and I never had any problems coming to this store. I  highly recommend them and go see Mitch who will go above and beyond.","561":"Terrible Gym, the ceiling in the mens shower room is falling apart, Sauna has not worked properly for 6 months, change rooms are freezing cold in the winter and the Management could care less. Stay away from this Good life.","562":"They don't deserve any stars! \nI am from out of state and my check engine light comes on and I have to get back on the road today. No, I don't have an appt. it's not like I know I need to get an oil change. Mazda: Sorry I can try to work you in but it's not fair to the other customers. How about appeasing the customer that is about to get on the road just to find out what's wrong and if I can safely drive home?  I didn't know my check engine light was going to come on. I understand about appt's but gee you can't just see what the issue may be and if I can drive it.","567":"I love this place.  I admit I am stuck on the Old Fashioned Turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce.  This is real fresh roast turkey (I think roasted daily but not sure) on great wheat bread, the sauce has just a bit of a bite and compliments the sandwich well.  Huge helping of turkey.  \n\nThe setting is in an old pecan grove with mature trees, and grass.  A very relaxed kind of place to just enjoy the Phoenix weather the food and those you are with.  It closes during the Summer and I can't wait for it to open back up in the Fall.\n\nThe perfect ending however, are the deserts.  They are all hommade, and terrific.  I can't get past the pecan pie, perhaps the best in Phoenix.  The crust is just right flaky, and it's loaded with pecans.  I'm hungry again just writing this review","570":"I don't normally like to do this, but I have to after the terrible experience I just had. Centurylink has the WORST customer service I've ever experienced. Two weeks ago I put in my order and the tech was scheduled to come in yesterday. Nobody showed up and nobody called to reschedule. Today I called, was on the phone for almost two hours, transferred to four people and was told they had to reschedule for Thursday, there was nothing they could do to help me earlier. I even talked to a supervisor who was the worst \"supervisor\" I've ever dealt with. Two hours later and I now have to wait until Thursday. Nobody apologized, nobody seemed to care. I told them if they don't come Thursday I'll be cancelling my service and going with Cox. Also, this whole time I was on their site talking with a live customer service rep online trying to figure this out, but all they told me was they couldn't do anything. So today's Worst Company Award goes to Centurylink.","572":"Worst Starbucks EVER!!!! The wait time is always crazy here no matter what time they only have one person working, they are always out of the baked goods in particular the cake pops is what i like.... so would not suggest this Starbucks to stop into... unless you have absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to be because you will be waiting.","575":"I admit that I haven't tried ALL the italian restaurants in Toronto... but of the ones that I have tried, Ciao has been the place that I've gone to multiple times. \n\nWhy? Let me count the ways:\n1. Reserved table is always ready \n2. Amazing service\n3. Fabulous Wine Selection\n4. The patio feels so European in the Summer\n5. The portions are huge!\n6. The quality and taste of the food is amaze\n7. It's in Yorkville - the perfect locale for a quaint after dinner walk\n8. The olives with the bread - delish!\n\nI feel like there's probably a lot more reasons - but I also feel like this is enough to make you want to check it out for yourself!\n\nps. Be sure to order the Mushroom Risotto - it's divine!!","576":"OPH all over this country is amazing. I've enjoyed them in Minneapolis, Chicago, LA and Seattle.  I cannot believe how bad this location is and I hate that this is the only location in the valley of the sun.  Please... someone... open another franchise somewhere else in this valley.. PLEASE!","577":"She is a wonderful person and talented piercer!! Awesome job and very professional... highly recommended..","579":"Hands down the best place to eat in Vegas! The food is priced well and the food is delicious! I would have eaten here everyday if I'd known this place was here! My wife absolutely loves this place as well. Service was awesome which is s bonus!","581":"I was skeptical about all these great reviews. After taking my car into the shop, I won't take my car anywhere else in the Phoenix area. \n\nCrawford's Auto repair was extremely thorough. They pinpointed a noise to three contributing factors: a rock in the tire, a roof rack bolt, and something in the sun roof. I love how detail-oriented these guys are. \n\nThey gave me a list of recommended repairs. Not once, did they push ... \n\nOverall, the experience was great. I found it easy to schedule an appointment. I respected the fact that they honored their estimated time frames. I love how communicative they were. \n\nHighly recommended!","584":"Very rude staff. Slow little to no communication between the team. Very grumpy short responses from multiple staff. \n\nThen they kept getting orders wrong and had the nerve to argue with a lady about it. Causing the line to go slower...don't argue make it right. \n\nStarbucks NYNY was very disappointing today. Wouldn't recommend coming back to this one.","585":"This is a hidden gem , the decor is a bit dated but the pizza is awesome.\nI'm from Chicago were pizza is King and Pizzafarros is my favorite in Scottsdale!!!","586":"Reservation = walk in.  Pointless to make reservations.  We made a reservation the day before for 11:00am the next day morning. When we arrived we are not being served but was asked to wait.  This is  pointless for reservation, as at the same time they still take walk in and people who has reservation is under the same queue with the walk in.  After 30min, we asked how much longer will be the wait? The lady answered \"no idea, I don't know\". Avoid this restaurant.","587":"An amazing collection of incenses. The salesman was really kind and had a very good knowledge about the incenses. He helped me choose the sandalwood I was looking for and he gave me some extra sticks for free. I'll definitely go back next time visiting Toronto.","591":"My first time visiting Sabor today and all I can say is what an absolute spectacular culinary experience! Their Latin Street food was fresh and very, very tasty. The Empanadas were perfectly cooked and juicy, not dry at all. The street corn, which is a favorite of mine, was the best I have had so far. I can highly recommend their shrimp and steak tacos which were soft and had great flavor. We ordered sliced avocado, creamy cold quacamole and together with the rosa sauce and fresh lime on the side made for a meal levels above what we paid for or expected. I love that you have so many choices to choose from to make up a meal that will satisfy any food cravings or preferences you might have and it is fresh and clean. On top of this the staff is friendly and very helpful. Such a joy! My kids loved this perfect little addition to Davidson as well and I can definitely see us becoming regulars.","592":"The tonkatsu ramen with black garlic oil, nori, and extra tamago is amazing. Definitely add the black garlic oil, it's a must! Everything here is prepared fresh and from scratch. It's definitely worth coming back to. Customer service is excellent and we truly loved our experience. The chefs are super helpful and they really care about their customers. It's a simple place with a small menu but their ramen is delicious. The noodles are freshly made as well as their pork. The soft boiled egg is perfectly made and isn't overly seasoned. I would recommend coming here.","594":"Ok, this place had us right from the start. My wife just finished  running a marathon and was extremely cold. Seeing her shiver, our waiter brought her a cup of homemade chicken vegetable soup on the house. Who does that these days?\n\nThe service really was great. From start to finish. The food was excellent. It was standard fare for a grill but you can tell those that prepared it really cared. \n\nI had the LA wrap and my wife had more soup. Both were really good. They make fresh, homemade soup every day. \n\nI'll be back. You should give them a try too.","598":"I've been here 10+ times now and each time the service has been excellent. They have slowed down a little since the grand opening like most places do which to me has only allowed them to improve.  I will continue to frequent this convenient location. \n\nThe quality of the food is still great and there's nothing hidden about how it's prepared. While you wait in line to order you can view openly where they prepare the food, so you know it's clean and up to standards. \n\nNo complaints here!","599":"Frybread is good, but there isn't enough substance. I got some watered down beans, hardly any ground beef and mostly lettuce.","601":"Yes, this IS as good as it gets!  Dr. Dameron and his team make going to the dentist actually a really good experience!  The whole staff is very professional, kind and accommodating.  Not to mention HAPPY!  The hygienists are just the best, as are all the staff.  Dr. Dameron's work is beautifully done and my teeth have never looked or felt better.  I HIGHLY recommend this whole office to anyone needing work done!  You will not be disappointed.","603":"I was very pleased with my visit yesterday the staff was friendly and got my drink out fast I wasn't sure what I wanted but I was helped by a young lady named Bella and she really took the time to listen and know what I wanted. She even continued to talk with me after I bought my coffee the employees really did make my day. I will continue to come back to this location.","610":"Never had a problem at this one until today. Guess they were to busy to care about the quality of their food. I ordered my regular Asiago ranch spicy chicken sandwich. Got my food at the window I always do a quality check no matter what, looked at my sandwich and it had honey mustard on it, last time I checked honey mustard and ranch were two different things. So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn't yellow and doesn't taste like honey mustard.  She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don't want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it. Wow imagine that someone who new how to make it without attitude. I'm still very disappointed money is money no matter where you spend it at. And I expect to get what I ask for with my money. Not something you just feel like free styling.","611":"We had my Mother's Birthday Party here on 10\/29\/16. What a Great time we all had. The food, music and waiters were Great!!! Thanks Lyles!!!","612":"WOW - this place is incredible.  It is huge, well lit, organized and everything is used and reasonably priced.  Saw this place on Yelp and had to check it out.  They advertise as an entertainment exchange store.  They take trades on books, magazines, movies, CDs, games......   I have never seen a used place this well, great.  Wish we had something comparable in Denver.","613":"I love this place... it's great to have a neighborhood center with good food and great coffee!!  The patio is great all year long.","614":"Shaunz sells the most unique shirts I have ever come across! The staff, quality of clothing, and selection is incredible. Thank you Shaunz for selling shirts online now!","617":"I was treated to lunch here and even for a free lunch it was not satisfying.\n\nFirst my french onion soup had very little flavor, almost watered down.  The cheese was overcooked and clumping and the bread was just... bread in my soup.\n\nI had the short ribs for my entree.  The ribs where extremely dry and overcooked.  The portions are small and the meat was so inedible that I didn't even finish my meal.  What flavor that was infused was just sauce cooked onto the meat and no flavor from the meat itself.  I was extremely disappointed.\n\nMy guess is that they garner the majority of their business from out of towners staying in the hotel it is connected to.  This will definitely not be in my lunch rotation downtown.","621":"A little pricey but worth it! Crepes were delicious! We got the seafood and chicken pesto. Really cute back area and service was good. Would come back!","622":"I searched for the closest shipping center near me, and found Safe Ship. To be honest, I chose this business primarily because of their high ratings. I had to ship two extra large packages to Hawaii, and wanted tracking and arrival signatures but didn't want to pay an arm & leg for it. Ben was of great help and got me the best deal possible with my packages' specific weights and dimensions. I couldn't be happier with my experience and highly recommend Safe Ship to anyone!","623":"My husband brought me here for our 2nd year anniversary and I love the ambience of this place.  That includes the music and environment.  The food was amazing.  We ordered the truffle fries and it was great!!!  I ordered the spicy seafood pasta and my husband ordered the amazing chicken and rice au gratin.  The cocktails were awesome and we had a great night.  The service was fast and the waiter was very pleasant to talk to.  It wasn't pricey either which was a surprise given the amazing service there.  This is a definite go!","630":"Very overpriced for what you get. I had the skirt steak which was stringy and tough. I've had much better meals at mad mex. Our server was extremely impersonal and we were rushed out. Will not return.","632":"Dr. Bang is by far the best chiropractor I've ever been to. Most chiropractors just crack all your joints and call it a day, but Dr. Bang believes chiropractics is not just about cracking bones. He finds the movement and alignment through other stimulation's such as heat therapy, electricity, and a couple other devices. We actually didn't start adjusting joints until my 4th visit! Every session I feel a lot better, he runs the facility by himself so when you come in it's a personable experience all around. Highly recommend!","633":"If you are looking for entertainment from the wait staff, save your time and money because you will not get it at this location.  Not only did we not have an interactive waitress, we did not see any around us.  We love Dick's Last Resort, however, going to this location was a total let down for our family.  This experience for us was nothing more than a very expensive dinner with no entertainment.  Very disappointing...","634":"This restaurant is a GEM!  Service was spectacular and the food was terrific. Based on Yelp review, I ordered the Traditional Greek Salad.  Absolutely fantastic - light dressing, HUGE size and totally delicious.  I strongly suggest going when they have their live entertainment.  Beyond my expectations.  We were treated like valued guests.  Try the spanokopita - it's delicious.   Belly dancing and live music with incredible singers.  What a delight.","637":"I hate that my review is going to contribute to the growing popularity of this place and me waiting longer to get a table in the future, but oh well.\n\nThis place has the best beer selection that I've seen in the city. The variety of beers is unparalleled. barVolo doesn't touch this Barhop! I also like that they let you do samplers of their draft beers.\n\nThe food is pretty good, too.\n\nReally they excel at all the things I've complained that was wrong about barVolo (see my other review).","639":"Listen don't complain that you got in late or the guy at the door was rude if you get there if you get there past 11pm who do you think you are the Kardashians?! I mean seriously I get bottle service every single time and I do not get there later than 10-1030 pm sure the club may still be empty but i would muchhh rather hang out at my sickkk table than wait in a line for 2 hours. AMAZING CLUB if you have game you willl have fun I highly recommend a table it is keyyy because you get tired of dancing for a few hours you go back to your table with some chicks hang out for a quick 20 then your back at it going nuts!","640":"Oddly enough, it was a negative Yelp review that drew me to Diamond's in the first place (a review I see is no longer on Yelp). But after putting up with crappy service just to get the Sourdough burger I love, the argument with a man who was either the GM or the owner about whether a service dog could come in his bar was the last straw. \n\nI'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog, but that was the last straw for me. \n\nI will miss the Sourdough Burger, but trust me when I suggest you find a nicer place and ask them to make a Sourdough burger (on sourdough bread with grilled onions and cheese).","643":"I love Salad and Go! Healthy delicious food on the fly. The best drive-through in Surprise! Very friendly staff & fast service. Have loved every single thing I've tried off the menu!","644":"When looking up hotels to stay in, I was skeptical about this and many other hotels, as one usually is in a city the've never visited. However, I was extremely pleased with my stay at Platinum.\n\nLocation: Located next to an AM\/PM gas station. This was great because I could pregame on the cheap before we went to various places. The hotel is very visible but still in the cut. About a half mile or so from the Venetian.\n\nCustomer Service: When I walked in, I was greeted with warmth. It was about 1 am, so not many people were in the lobby. Which was actually the case throughout my entire trip. I chatted with the front desk associate like we were old friends. He was just that nice. And he made me feel so welcome!\n\nRoom: Can I tell you that this room was EVERYTHING in LIFE?! Ok. There I told you. I was in room 402 I believe. This room was in fact a suite. I felt like it was an apartment and I had a lease. Freaking HUGE! It had separate areas for a kitchen (complete with full fridge, stove \/ oven, microwave, dishwasher and bar), living room, balcony, bedroom with 2 queen beds, a safe, closet and tv and bathroom with closet, garden tub, separate bathroom and double sink vanity. The bathroom was the size of most rooms. Completely clean!!!!\n\nI stayed in it by myself. What a wondrous time!!!!!!! I had everything I needed and then some. And the view! Perfect view of the strip. It's the perfect way to be a part of Vegas without all the noise and smoke you get in a hotel with a casino. At half the price. Or less, depending on when you go. My first night in Vegas was spent relaxing in my beautiful room.\n\nTip: Even if you can't go get a full massage or service at the spa, at least purchase a cupcake bath salt from them and use in that beautiful tub. So relaxing!\n\nI will def be bringing my sister and cousin back this March! Can't wait!\n\nIm sure I left something out but you get the gist right? If not....stay here!! You won't regret it!","645":"I have been eating sushi a LONG TIME. This place was so wonderful. Great sushi! I strongly recommend eating here. Enjoy","646":"Stopped here for lunch after our dam tour based on yelp reviews. We were starving and this place hit the spot. Do yourself a favor and get the cheese sticks!  YUM!  Girlfriends had the bacon burger and said it was top notch. I had the BBQ chicken salad and it was also very good. Service was good too. All in all 6 thumbs up from the 3 of us!","647":"Great place.  We stayed at the Hermosa Inn, and dinner and breakfast at Lon's were included as part of our package.  We were warmly greeted by the gentleman who was the host upon entering.  Dinner was fantastic - the strip steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Started with the tortilla soup and finished with the panna cotta.  But our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow!  Thought it was great that they had local beer options from McFate Brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful, and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday. \n\nWe returned for breakfast the next day.  Breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options, but the food was really good.  I had the ham & cheese omelette, which was great.  Large portion of toast accompanied my omelette, and the crispy potatoes that came with the omelette were really good.  \n\nOverall a really great experience - wouldn't hesitate to return for an upscale meal.","651":"Fastening vibe and Vegas Strip friendly. Staff takes care considerably and is very current. Love the scenery! Thank you Azuza staff. xoxo ACE ENCORE","653":"We love Kneader's! Their French toast is literally the best French toast ever. And their breakfast sandwich on a croissant is sooooo yummy. We always have the best service there. Workers are nice and friendly and we get our food quickly. Highly recommend Kneaders! A great place to go to brunch with friends.","656":"This place no longer exists. The site is empty and available for rent. Too bad, not sure if another quilt shop close by!","657":"I both attended and hosted multiple events at Sigmas - training, executive offsite meeting and a retirement party.  The staff are professional and very organized.  Every detail  has been considered - from extra insulated windows to keep out street noise to decaffeinated ice tea.  All the touches a trainer or meeting facilitator could wish for in the technology and variety of spaces (whether board room, lunch cafe, formal reception area, or training room).","659":"We have been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally went Saturday evening.  We sat on the patio and had some delicious cocktails.  We eventually went in and sat at a table for dinner.  The chicken and waffle appetizer was delicious.  For entrees we ordered the shrimp and grits and the steak.  Everything was delicious except for that the cook could not get my steak right.  They tried three times to achieve medium rare but just couldn't get it right.  Fortunately, for me our waitress who was fabulous was more upset about it than I was.  She would take it back to the kitchen even before I had the opportunity to complain.  The manager stopped by and was so apologetic and gave us a gift card to come back.  Even though I would probably never order the steak again, we will definitely be back for the ambience, the drinks, the other yummy food, but most of all for the EXCELLENT customer service that is so rare to find these days.  Well done Trey!  Thank you!","662":"The amazing food and friendly atmosphere keeps us coming back!! My hubby is vegetarian and we love how we can choose anything off the menu for the both of us and it tastes delicious!","663":"I honestly love this location! Blanca is always so welcoming and friendly. Her personality definitely makes it a fun experience! Every time I come in my food is fresh or if I ask for it to be made fresh they will make it. We ordered the orange chicken and Kung pow chicken tonight and it was soooo yummy. I love coming back here because the staff makes me feel like I live in a small town where people know each other and say hi with a smile.","667":"We had breakfast there today for about $25 each with tax and fees included but 2 of our party of 4 were covered by the bed and breakfast deal from JW Marriott and they didn't charge for the kid. Food was ok but plentiful and what makes it a 5-star for me is the ambience and the patio with the beautiful koi pond and cascades, refreshing in a summer morning. Staff was attentive amd we were there at 10 and breakfast ends at 11 but didn't fell pressured at all and nobody gave us looks for taking some fruit with us on our way out ;-)","668":"Got another cut and had my first ever straight razor face shave from Thom \"Slick Boy\".  Book an appointment with this master barber who has mad skills and takes his time making it right.  He makes you feel comfortable with his laid back vibe and easy conversation.  He doesn't disappoint.  You walk out looking and feeling awesome.","671":"So fresh and delicious! My go to poke spot in the city! Generous portions, clean and great selection of accouterments!","672":"Had a fantastic experience at this barber shop. Claude was fantastic and is such a great person to talk to while in the chair. This is an art to him, not just a haircut. He takes his time and has great conversation with his patrons. Such a wealth of knowledge on the area, and such a fantastic person to talk to. Greatly appreciated his service and his skill. Kudos to Claude!!!","674":"My experience with Dr. Malek has been nothing short of fantastic. His staff is professional and kind, and they're great at answering questions without being pushy or sales-like. Dr. Malek was kind while retaining a very professional demeanor. (Honestly, the first time I met with him, I had almost wished that he had been a bit more \"friendly\" vs. doctor-patient, but he was obviously experienced and competent. On the day of the surgery, I appreciated that bit of professional distance that he kept and felt comfortable in his hands and under his care.)  He and his staff were great about working with my crazy schedule and finding times that would work for me. Everything was very upfront. There were zero hidden charges or unexpected costs. Dr. Malek customized the procedure to obtain the best results for my particular situation and explained to me in detail what he suggested and why he felt it was the best approach. The results are incrdible. (I've used the word magician quite a few times when speaking about Dr. Malek's skill.) Pain or discomfort was exremely minimal and I can't begin to describe how thrilled I am that I chose to have the procedure done and to have Dr. Malek do it.","675":"I visited Beltway for the first time during the Hunt for my first Handgun at the beginning of the year. From my very first interaction with Branden, I gathered that they are more honest and forthright than several that I had visited. They are well informed but might not have answers to all your questions. However, they would help search for the proper answer rather than mislead you. \nI have bought a few guns, several accessories and a Scope from here after (offcourse) doing my due diligence. I have been extremely satisfied with all my purchases.\n\nYou can expect Friendly personnel, Reasonable prices and Great communication at Beltway.","677":"Just got one of the worst haircuts of my life from a girl named Alex. Had to go home and use my own clippers to cut away her terrible job! TERRIBLE! Beware","679":"My wife ate here and I had pizza from another place she had the Vinnys sandwich and it was huge and it was so huge and so much she ate half and couldn't eat no more gave the other half to a older lady later that day we saw her walking down the strip and she said the sandwich was excellent to my wife really liked it it was just too much for one person to eat","680":"Yeah, service continues to go downhill. Take your money elsewhere.  \n\nPaid for the works. They didn't even wipe the dash or any of the interior. Outside still has crap all over it. Should have gone back inside and asked for a refund. \n\nThis place sucks.","681":"These people are amazingly friendly, helpful and have high integrity. I feel very happy to have found them when I moved back to Phoenix and need someone to care for my car.","682":"Wow, so delicious.  I don't have any pictures to post because we ate everything too fast!\n\nWe used the check-for free coffee and tea to start while we munched on the complementary granola, which was a nice roasted salty and sweet flavor.  Then our savory crepes came out quickly, the breakfast burrito for him and a custom buckwheat for me (white cheddar since they were out of Gouda, with local ham).  Mine came with a side of dressed greens that complemented the crepe well.  I was disappointed I could only order scrambled eggs on the side when I wanted a gooey poached egg because they had already cracked all the eggs, so I skipped the eggs.\n\nAs we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out.  I was surprised how full I was from the one savory crepe, but I made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts.  You can really taste the quality of the crepe itself when it's minimally dressed.  We finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service.  We struck up some good conversation with the server and found everyone but the cashier to be friendly.  I will definitely be back soon!","685":"Always taken care of at this company. This was my first visit to this location since moving from the east side, and Tony really took care of me with a price match. These guys here are great at customer service and once again left extremely happy.  \n\nIf you need tires, this is a must visit.","688":"My daughter and her boyfriend were very excited to go here. They paid almost $200 for 2 Buffet of Buffet 24 hour passes . They had crab sushi shrimp and oysters. \nThen about 2 hours later she started feeling very Sick . For the next 2 days she could barely move , vomiting , diarrhea cold sweats . Her whole vacation was ruined. \nWe returned to the Rio seafood buffet talked to manager MIKE . \nFilled out the security forms  with the EMT .   \nMike tells us that even though she got food poisoning from there seafood . And could not use the 24 hour pass . He could not give a refund. But He offered a free buffet if she wanted to eat there again... Really ???  \nGood luck eating here!!!!\nYou go to a casino to gamble money ,not your health!","689":"One of my coworkers mentioned this little spot he heard about not too far from work. So today for lunch a few of us decided to check it out. My personal favorite places are hole in the wall joints so walking into this restaurant definitely provided that vibe. Miss Dee, the owner I believe, was one of the nicest owners I have met at a restaurant. She immediately came out of the kitchen and personally greeted us with amazing hospitality. She gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had. Now onto the meat and potatoes, literally! Three of us got a large loaded potato, each topped with different meats. One had the beef brisket, the other had pulled pork, and I got the buffalo chicken. Don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved. Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato. Combine that with melted cheese, sour cream, and other delicious toppings, this potato can't be beat!  Will definitely be a return customer to try out other various customizations on my loaded potato!","691":"I miss Tram so much I wish I could've taken her with me to AZ she's knows what I want and exactly how I want my hands to look. Whenever I needed her to fix a nail she did it without complaints she was always happy to perfect my hands","693":"Today my friend and I came in for a body massage.  Let me tell you! The staff was very consistent, they ask you if you're okay while giving you massage in troubled areas. Very relaxing and clean. I didn't get my misuses name but she did a fantastic job.  And I came home feeling so relaxed with no more tight pressure in my back. I am so happy my friend and I chose this place.","694":"When I was looking for a new groomer as my old one was moving out of town I was asking my groomer at the time who she would recommend and she mentioned Diane at Razzle Dazzle. I can start with saying I was a little hesitant about taking my \"kids\" to just anyone 1) Razzle Dazzle is out of my way about 10 miles and 2) she was new. I'm so glad I called Diane and after talking to her on the phone I felt confident that she was the one who would take over caring for my little ones.  I have been taking my \"kids\" to Razzle Dazzle now for a couple years. All I can is Diane is simply AMAZING!!!! Let's just say I would travel an additional 30 miles if it meant that Diane would still be caring for my \"kids\".","695":"I called them at 10.30 saying ill be there in 15 minutes given they close at 11. When I arrived with a party of 15 ( which I mentioned on the phone) they denied me and were extremely rude. Lack of professionalism and courtesy.","696":"Five stars for the Iced Espresso Bianco!!!  I am not an iced coffee fan, whatsoever, but this was amazing.  We were at the Venetian for date night - dinner and a show, so got here early to walk around.  We stopped in here to get a drink and I took a chance on this drink.  I did get the caramel flavor, but it was not to flavored, which I was happy about.  Not sure how they layered it, but the frothed milk was on top and it mixed it on its own and\/or with stirring - so flavorful.  This drink really kept the coffee flavor without getting diluted by the ice or caramel.  I wish I had one later today!","698":"I LOVED this buffet. To me it was comparable to The Buffet at The Wynn. They had prime rib, warm snow crab legs, ceviche, sushi, an omelet bar, and a little of everything. Tons of desserts as well!! Define lay coming back next trip to Vegas..","699":"Oh my goodness.... where to start?!! I had the pleasure of enjoying some BBQ chicken, beans and potato salad about a week ago. Not only was the meat perfectly tender and juicy, but the beans, oh my god the beans. Talk about perfection. On top of the delicious food, the service I received was beyond 5 stars. I was offered a sample while working and was told he could bring the food into me at my convenience but I didn't take advantage assuming that I would be able to catch him outside and take a look at my options. Unfortunately for me as I was walking out of the building Steven was pulling away. He saw me though, and as I expressed my sadness in missing my opportunity. He so kindly and without hesitation pulled over and prepared me the dish of my choosing. He was so gracious and even gave me a small story of how he got started. I would recommend Holy Smoke BBQ to ANYONE and EVERYONE! My heart and my belly were so full! Thank you again for your extremely generous service!","701":"The store has a nice men's department downstairs.     The sale items are all the way in the back near the dressing rooms, check it out for great deals....\n\nThe salespeople are friendly and helpful.    This store has a great coffee shop right by the men's department...where you can get a drink and a pastry.   Comfy seating makes it for a great little coffee spot.\n\nClub Monaco is a bit on the pricey side, but I usually find great sales that are a great value..","702":"I love this nail salon. They are very friendly and attentive. They make the experience fun. My nails turned out Greeeeeeat. I'm moving across town but this will still be my nail salon. You travel for good service.","703":"PROS: I love this lee's location! it's my favorite to go to since it's near my home. it has everything you would want, they even have a growing sake collection!! they restock a lot. \n\nthe staff is really helpful, I'm always asking them questions and they are nice and pretty knowledgable. \n\nthere are always good prices \n\nCONS: sort of back alley, private area. it's a little cluttered and heavily stacked inside!\n\nOVERALL: by going here, you have the ability to make any outing into a good time ;)","705":"What can you say about this place that hasn't already been said. The hype is true, and we're lucky to have nationally renown chef Chris Bianco stay here in Phoenix all these years. Pizzas are perfect, and pastas are surprisingly great & fresh (if you can resist ordering a pizza). Menu is often changing and new additions and recommendations are usually worth taking. Have not yet been to the original downtown location, am intimidated by no reservations and what I expect to be long lines for a reputable place. The \"Town & Country\" location is fashionable shabby chic, not intimidating. Parking is kind of a cluster. Look forward to coming here again on the next possible date night.","707":"My sister-in-law and I saw Jeff at the start of the year... we saw his ad and we decided it was something we would want to check out... and we are so glad we did!  \n\nJeff is hilarious and has great stage presence and really connects with his audience.  I even got pulled up on stage and got a crotch full of Jeff!  hahaha... \n\nIt's a very high energy show that he never lets up... he just goes and performs his little heart out much to the enjoyment of the audience.  \n\nIf you're looking for a family friendly show that is different from the usual entertainment on the Strip then you cannot go wrong with Jeff Civillico!","709":"Previously, my review was removed. So let's try again. I started to come here in 2011 and I LOVED Neos. But now, if I could I would give this place a ZERO.  Sherrie was the girl that always did my laser and it was comfortable to be around. As my six treatments went up, I signed up and made a new package, and then soon again, those six were up, and I signed up again. THIS TIME THOUGH, I spoke to Monica before I signed anything. I wanted to make sure I would get a refund for any treatments if Sherrie was to leave or if they were to move locations because I was well aware that their policies are not very consumer-friendly. Well, guess what? They moved locations and nobody told me and my appt. had been cancelled. I called Neos to see what the deal was and Brian was super rude and said he would never agree to a refund, even though it is written in my chart. He said he can \"make it worth my while\" to drive all the way to another office which is 45 minutes from my house when I was only driving 20 to Peoria. He offered me a free microderm... I'm 20 and I told him I don't want one and he said that he would suggest it since my face needs a \"detailing\".... If that isn't rude I don't know what is. It gets better because he told me his tech Charlene is great and that she is BETTER then Sherrie and has a lot more experience. I did not think that it was professional to talk trash about former employees... especially when I have done so many  treatments with them. I have requested my chart to be faxed to me and nobody has gotten back to me. I had two treatments left and he wouldn't refund those treatments, even though I have been a loyal customer for so long. Instead of microderms, how about paying for gas and miles? Super rude service, DO NOT GO HERE.","711":"After an afternoon hike along the Don River, we were in dire need of some sweet sweet therapy.  Close proximity to downtown we decided to venture towards Lickadee Split on Coxwell.  I have a soft-spot for soft-serve and confectioneries! With a ton of selections to choose from Lickadee Split is a classic, popular and awesome joint for some cool treats if you're ever in the east-end of the city. \nBeware their one scoop is a MASSIVE one, thankfully the person helping me recommended I first see their quantity before being so keen on jumping on the two-scoop-wagon.  Thankfully One was enough, both Jen and I each took something we liked.\nChocolate Fudge was for her.  Over-decadent, every chocolate-lovers love! \n\nGold Ribbon- mix of caramel, chocolate, and vanilla, I truly loved this trio of flavor, each complemented one another. TRULY delicious!","718":"Best bean and cheese burrito in town!! Our kids beg us to take them there weekly. My sister used taco dilla's catering for a graduation\/birthday party for her kids and they did a faboulos job. The set up was top notch and the food was always well stocked . Their customer service was on point . All of the food was amazing stand outs- steak and blue cheese quesadillas! Yum yum","720":"Oh my gosh I fell in love with this place today! Lots of vegan options, delicious food - my fav was the falafel and baba ghanoush - and friendly service. Prices are reasonable too. Can't wait to go back for the open face eggplant soon!","721":"Snobbish receptionist, good waiters, food is identical to any other Cheese cake factory. And finally they invented a slice of cake that's 1750 calories.  That's art !!!  But their 500 calorie \" diet\" cheesecake is pretty good. Empty at lunchtime !","724":"Hands down, best jerky!  I bought the Sweet Heat for myself, which was the perfect amount of heat, I ate the entire bag in one sitting!  My son loves the Teriyaki Beef and I couldn't forget my \"fur-kids\", I bought them a bag of the beef and a bag of the turkey Top Ten dog treats, they went CRAZY for the stuff!  Customer service was awesome too, really cool guys working the shop.  Love this place!","725":"I've stayed at ALL hotels on the strip. Even when Stardust and Frontier was around. I've encountered the atmosphere, the check-in lines, the restaurants, the pools, and the nightclubs of these hotels. HANDS DOWN, Venetian & Palazzo has the best to offer in luxury. Yes, there are clubs better than TAO, and better restaurants than the Grand Lux, but those hotels with don't have great service or great decor or rooms as the Venetian. It's like some hotels focus on one great trait (day club, night club, room accommodations), but the Venetian has it all across the board. Tables are loose, Rooms are suite, family side of pool and adult side. Cosmo is catching up though...but yeah The Venetian is definitely tight butthole","729":"Looked this place up before making appointment, April did a great job. I had to wait a while even with an appointment but they apologized and serviced me and my daughter to our satisfaction. Their hot stone massage was great and you get a full foot and calf massage as part of the $20. Great price, good service.\n\nOAN: It was a little dusty in there. They may want to look into remodeling, but not if that is going to increase the prices. ;-)","731":"Still the best dinner buffet on the strip. Start with the king crab and shrimp cocktails. Then move on the specialty meats.  Everything sings quality...especially the hand made desserts.","732":"I went in with what felt like a laundry list of items to accomplish. Completely dreading and actually greatly postponing my visit, I was incredibly surprised at how great and simple it was to accomplish what I needed. Ashley was lovely when she greeted me at the door to begin the process of helping me figure out what I needed and who to go to for help. Stephan has been incredible with assisting my every need, answering all of my questions and making the process as simple as possible. I am thrilled with the service I have received at this location and am glad I have made the move to BOA.","733":"Their web site lured me in, impressive as it is... \"Largest service fleet in the area... etc. etc.\" \n\nThey said they could fix our LG washer, but then they didn't stock the parts, had to special order them, and when the new parts were installed, the machine didn't work.\n\nWell, they get ZERO stars for not fixing the washer. They get ZERO stars for charging us for a service call when they had no real solution. They were kind enough to remove the new (bad? wrong?) parts, and to refund our money for them. \n\nBut then, THEY GAVE UP, blaming LG for being a crappy company, and suggesting we buy a Whirlpool. Well, maybe that's true, and probably a good suggestion, although this $900 washer was highly recommended by Consumer Reports about five years ago, when we bought it. You would think if they are authorized to repair LG washers, that they would do a better job at customer service. \n\nNow I have to call LG, file a complaint, and find a *real* solution provider. This is a real *hassle* I don't need right now. \n\nWhatever happened to the old, \"We'll get it right, or you don't pay a dime!\" guarantee? Does anyone still offer that in the Appliance Repair category? Everyone wants a minimum charge for a service call, whether they actually do anything or not. What a sour taste that leaves in the customer's mind! Take the money and run is no way to go through life, folks!","734":"As always the 6 month checkup went very well.  Brian was on time, very knowledgeable and answered all questions with patience with both me and my husband.   Highly recommend.","736":"Amy is amazing and an outstanding example of going above and beyond. I cannot thank her enough for taking the time out of her time off on a Saturday to ensure we were taken care of.\n\nMy father in law passed away late Friday, June 2nd. We went to the funeral home at 12 noon Saturday June 3rd to make arrangements for his visitation, funeral and graveside service. We left after 2pm and went to another florist in the area that was a friend of the family. No offense to that florist, her selections were slim pickings and she didn't seem too accommodating since she was low on fresh cut flowers because of \"prom weekend\". My wife was so upset because she wanted the perfect flower arrangement for her \"daddy\".\n\nWe began calling to realize that florist shut down and close shop early on Saturdays. I also know that sometimes a shop owner will still be around working, even though the shop is closed. I called Talley's and left a message... it was a shot in the dark. My wife didn't want to wait until Monday to figure this out when the visitation was scheduled for that evening. \n\nAfter about 20 minutes of giving up, my phone rang... it was Amy! She took the time to talk with us outside of business hours. She was sympathetic and compassionate towards us and our circumstances. We trusted her expertise and experience to provide us with an beautiful flower\/plant combination.\n\nWe arrived to the funeral home Monday evening and looked for the flower\/plant arrangement. WOW! It was so beautiful! My wife started crying. It was exactly why she wanted.\n\nAmy went above and beyond for us. Her expert knowledge combined with taking the time to listen to us to understand our wishes produced an amazing arrangement. She is an example of what your floral experience should be. We would recommend Amy and Talleys Florist with full knowledge of how she interacts with actual customers.","737":"I highly recommend this Chandler Crossroads ME.  It's clean and inviting.  The front staff are very helpful, polite and always have a smile on.  Rooms are clean and welcoming.  There are plenty of therapists each with their own strengths and all very competent.  It took me a few therapists, not that they weren't all very good, to find the one for me.  Ask for Heather G but be prepared to book at least 3 weeks out if you want her...yes she's worth it.  I always look forward to my next visit.  Check this place out.  You'll leave relaxed and well taken care of.","738":"The best there is! We interviewed several pool companies and talked to countless friends and coworkers about their pool building experiences. We couldn't find one person who loved their pool builder. We are happy to say we picked a winner! We found Thunderbird by searching the internet, we could not find a bad review and loved their website photos. We scheduled an appt with Les, their designer. Les is wonderful.  He is the total opposite of your traditional pool salesman. He took his time in listening to our needs and wants. We had a challenge because we live on a large parcel of land and wanted the pool to be a focal point. He drew a gorgeous design and continued to work with us until we loved both the plan and budget. Once we gave them the go it was so smooth I'm still in awe! Cynthia called every few days to tell me the schedule, when and whom would be in our yard. Every single person was on time and got their job done as scheduled. Our friends and family could not believe the speed and quality of our pool. We've been finished about 5 weeks and absolutely love our pool! If your searching for an incredible pool and spa builder please do yourself a favor and call Thunderbird. We will continue to  share our recommendation to anyone else looking to build a pool.","739":"My wife and I have been clients of Dr. Tran and Floss Dental Orthodontics since they opened their office on West Cheyenne 9 years ago. When we moved across to the southwest side of town, we moved over to this location. All of the dentists and staff are so professional and kind. One of the most important things to my wife and I is a clean and sterile environment. The office is immaculate and is completely up to date with all of the latest technologies. We absolutely recommend this to all of our family and friends.","740":"I wanted to David Carradine with the lobster spaghetti.","745":"OMG SO good!! I can't wait to go back!! Love the atmosphere and the food was amazing (I had the eggplant)....This was one of my favorite culinary experience of my life! We didn't leave anything in our plate!!! Thank you guys!!!","750":"Best Chinese food in LKN area. Never disappointed with the take out we get.  They speak English well too!","751":"We order from this Pizza Hut often and always order a very similar order a stuff crust pizza with chicken, Bacon, and onion on half. We ordered today and the pizza had onion on the whole thing. The manager was rude and didn't want to replace the pizza. After telling him I will come in and talk to the store manager did he change his attitude toward the situation.","752":"Price was good, service was professional , quality is outstanding. These guys are connected to the guys at Toronto T's. I could not be happier with both of their services, I use them regularly and would not hesitate to recommend them.","754":"Flies on the pizza that was sitting out there.  Ew.  Very disgusting.  I would NOT recommend it ... very unsanitary!","755":"Although I have had a few problems with the front desk staff,  I love this place because of my Doctor.  He is the nicest, most caring sweet attentive doctor I've ever seen!  I don't know what I would do without him!  Michael Tucker is the best! !!!","756":"I love it! Almost all options are available in a vegan version. Yum!\nI am moving, and am so sad I will not longer be able to come here. So I made one last trip today. I hope they consider expanding so I can enjoy the yummy items here once again.","761":"Cheap tickets, awful staff, probably a good idea they got the self serve kiosks. The remodel is nice but doesn't make up for the lousy customer service and rude popcorn makers","762":"My search for the best beautician with great customer service skills,  hairstylist and applying my weaves are over. Rasheen's skills surpassed my expectations. Rasheen's expertise in the use of different techniques that would be best for your natural hair when applying your weave, shows that she cares about your natural hair. My hair looks amazing, and I have received so many compliments.","766":"The Turnhouse Grille has what a lot of restaurants in Charlotte are missing... personality and memorable food! Turnhouse is locally owned and staffed with people who genuinely want to be there to make your experience memorable. John and Katie regularly tend bar and and will amaze you with their creativity, homemade bitters, and signature drinks and Sam is there to greet you with her smile and knowledge of the menu. The food and is simply spectacular and the kitchen staff is spot-on with their creations and presentation. My favorites eats are the Shrimp Burger, The Hef Wings, Salmon BLT, and the Pork Chop. I'd wake up from a coma to eat that Shrimp Burger!!! Simply delicious and friendly place to hang out with friends.","767":"Extremely friendly staff. Smaller seating area than most Nekter Juice Bars, but that has been no problem. Always get my custom order correct. No issues. LOVE location! Conveniently close to physical therapy clinic where I run on antigravity treadmill & blocks from my OBGYN's office. Ample parking.","768":"Used EAT24 take out. Great pizza. Wings are good.  We'll worth it. I will be using them over the hut in the future","769":"Yoli's is a a great place to have breakfast.  The staff is wonderful and you ALWAYS receive great customer service.  The prices are great, the food is wonderful and the portion size leaves you quite full.  I usually can't finish my meal and end up with a nice snack for later.","770":"If you looking for the good customer service stay away from this restaurant, the lady work from here never say hi to the customer i went this restaurant yesterday i was so surprised her rude attitude to customer i asked her to about seat and she said \"just go seat any where!\" I still dont know why she answer me with harsh tone voice","771":"When scheduling for your cleaning, ask for Miss Julia.... She's great!","773":"worst experience I've ever had with dr. Torres I found out I was pregnant in July  but ended up  having a miscarriage in September . few appointments that I had with him he was very cold shouldered and I didn't feel he was really listening to what I had to say about my pregnancy that far. apparently after my 1st blood tests my estrogen was low so he prescribed me Progesterone 100 milligrams once a day. things didn't work out so come end of September I ended up scheduling a D&C. at that appointment he expressed that I probably have an estrogen issue since this was my 2nd miscarriage. He didn't know that by now????? smh...already frustrated with this location & this doc I was told I had to get went a follow-up. I did & he didn't even check me (didn't undress), he only asked me a few questions anything wrong, if I was trying to get pregnant again right away, if I want birth control pills and that was prety much the end of the visit. This doc didn't seem to care about my well being and didn't care enough to take better precautions with my blood results. oh & while he was asking me questions before my surgery he answered a personal call in front of me...he was talking about his hurt hip, a trip aka vacation, that he feels better now & he got rest... then slowly walked out of my room. horrible!!! the waiting time for this location is 2hrs plus. I would not go to this location!!!!!","774":"This is my favorite place to go for sushi, because of the ambiance, service, and overall quality of the menu items. \n\nThe ambiance is welcoming (literally, with the chefs and servers acknowledging every patron's entrance with a warm greeting, as per Japanese tradition), and it never gets too busy or over-crowded, so there's no reason to awkwardly wait around ever. It's a good place for a first date, not only because sushi's romantic like that, but because it's never too startlingly quiet or loud. There's just enough going on in this restaurant to keep everyone interested without being obnoxiously distracting.\n\nSince the space isn't very large, there's usually only one server on duty, but they always somehow manage to be attentive to all tables. One thing out of the ordinary is that I've always had to ask for the bill, or pay directly at the cashier. If not, I could be waiting for hours before my server would offer to bring it over.\n\nThe fish is always fresh and inventive. My favorite is the sashimi salad. It's my all time favorite, the vinaigrette is a perfect tartness in contrast with thin strips of salmon, tuna, octopus, and mackerel. I could eat it forever. Other menu items are always cute and beautifully presented. There are even local nods to the Flames, with the 'Red Mile Roll,' and 'Red Hot Flames Rolls.' \n\nI give Sushi Dining Chopsticks a 5-star rating for being an overall awesome dinner destination.","775":"So....they changed their prices. One star because the girl at the counter was sweet. I used to get the grilled chicken pasta for 9.00 and now it's 15.00! I can't afford to go back. I think loyalty supercedes trying to make an extra buck. Be loyal to your customers and they will return. I would have been sympathetic to a dollar more, but that's too high a jump. The pasta is good, but not Olive Garden in California  great. I'll never understand why food tastes better in Cali.","776":"There are some mixed reviews here about Fresh and from a food creativity standpoint I can appreciate that on some of the menu items. However, you're getting what you came for and that's what matters to me. \n\nA mainstay for meal options when I'm traveling, Fresh has fresh bowls, juices and more. Yes it might just be rice and steamed greens but their sauces enhance everything.  When I come for healthy vegan food, that's all I really want. I don't care for the vegetables to be made into unrecognizable too small, creative portions. With that being said, Fresh still has some interesting spins on their menus, most notably the quinoa onion rings which are out of this world! And their homemade hot sauce is equally as good (I finish half the jar with every meal). I just wish there was somewhere like this in Calgary.","777":"Only my second maybe third time in life in Outback. I came late because that's how I roll. I really don't enjoy a crowd.  Headed straight for the bar which was pleasantly open. Kayla was my bartender, made me a flavored ice tea because I didn't want water or regular unsweetened ice tea. Cheers to that and then she made the the huckleberry moonshine cocktail, only 140 calories. My meal was a 11oz center cut steak, sweet potato and brocoli and cheese. All the food was deliciously seasoned. I'll be back","778":"Just fulfilled a bucket list item and got my nose pierced!! This shop is beautiful!! So clean!! The staff is super friendly. I was nervous but the piercer calmed me down with his sense of humor. Great place!!! It's so nice to have a quality shop on the Westside.","783":"Awesome breakfast!!! Had the Rubin Benedict and wow was it good! Loved it!! Kid friendly & mom approved,  in fact she had the Florentine Benedict... Good service and prices.","784":"Wow! I had the new nexgen technique instead of the old gel nail method and I luv it! Tommy did a great job. No more harsh chemicals and horrible soaking in that poison!  Everyone should try it.I totally recommend it.","785":"Absolutely amazing. Think Chipotle for enchiladas. Nice patio, plenty of room inside. The food is really amazing. The prices are great. If you're not in the area it's actually worth the trip. \n\nI ordered 2 chicken enchiladas. I'll be back to try the tacos!","789":"My husband and I drove by Rani's a couple weeks ago and he said, \"International Market? That looks interesting.\"  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, \"$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!\"\n\nSo that is how we wound up at Rani's.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I'm a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.\n\nEverything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen.\n\nAfter we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There's also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.\n\nI considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can't blame them.","792":"AWFUL AWFUL PEOPLE! I'm only giving them one star because I can't post otherwise, but they're not even worth that. I used MovingAPT.com to find them - won't ever use them again either. I thought having an agent would prevent this kind of crap from happening. I don't even know where to start with my complaints; this entire move was a mess from the beginning due to lack of communications and professionalism. I paid extra for a specific move date and time, as well as a 'special handling fee' because of my piano. \n\nWhen they arrive for the pick-up - 2 days late 6 hours after they were supposed to be there - they didn't come prepared for a piano. My dad and uncle had to find 2x4's to use as a ramp and help the movers hold it and roll it off the porch. This is a stage piano, the wheels aren't really meant for rolling around cement! After loading everything and telling my parents they were headed my way (Virginia), my stuff is taken from Wyoming to Seattle, then back to Vegas where it was put in storage without my knowledge or permission. I only found out because I kept calling to see the whereabouts of the truck so I could plan accordingly. After repeated phone calls, and finally the threat of legal action, my items were put back on a truck and started the journey East. \n\nFinally, they call to tell me they'll be there on June xx, which is exactly during the 3-day window I said I would be out of the state and not be able to receive the truck - again, all covered BEFORE the contract was even signed. So I'm told if I can't get a friend to meet them at my house and let them in, they'd go on to New York with my stuff and I'd have to pay an additional fee to get it, whenever they brought it back to me, which would be at their discretion. Luckily, I was able to get a hold of someone and coordinate with them to receive the shipment, upon which he started taking pictures the moment the truck was opened. (see below). After they had unloaded everything and AFTER I had confirmed 3 times over the course of this month that they had the proper equipment, they realize that in fact, they don't have anything to move the piano. So they decide they'll go to Home Depot, hire random men, and carry\/lift the piano into my house. You don't LIFT a piano! So my friend that's there says no, it's too heavy, you need the proper equipment, I suggest you go find it. So then they tell him that they need to get on the road to New York for their next job so they'll just go put my piano in a warehouse until I was back so I'd let them deliver it. Again, they're told no, at which point the driver calls me while I'm in the airport and says if I don't let them into my house I'd have to pay a second delivery fee. I told them not to leave the state with my piano and I'd call them right back - so I call my friend and ask what's going on; he gives me the scoop. I asked him if he'd run up the street - about 4 blocks from my house - and secure a storage unit that these guys could back the truck right up to the ramp, get the piano on a dolly and store it there for two days til I could get a professional. He said OK, and while I'm still on the phone, I hear him say exactly that to the driver. I call the driver back myself and say the same thing. I literally asked them to wait 15 minutes while we got this taken care of; he said OK. My friend leaves, gets the paperwork for a storage unit, comes back and these guys have unloaded the piano, ROLLED it down the sidewalk (no dolly), tried to lift it up my 4 steps, DROPPED it, eventually go it inside, and we're RUNNING TO THEIR TRUCK when my friend gets back. They hadn't given him the inventory sheets or had him sign anything, so he hollers at them and runs after. He had to jump in his own vehicle to chase them down and cut them off before they stopped. At that point they gave him the paperwork - still not signed - and took off again. \n\nAs soon as I got home that same evening I went right to the piano to take a look and started taking pictures. I called the driver and asked what had happened. He said nothing, everything was fine, no damage. I called BS and told him I'm standing in my living room looking at the damage. He hung up and I've never been able to get a hold of these people since.","793":"I just moved from New York to Charlotte and was having a hard time finding a threading salon, decide to give this place a shot and I am very happy with the results! Customer service was spectacular, reasonably priced, and very satisfied with how my eyebrows look. Will definitely be coming back and recommend for anyone! Once you thread your eyebrows you will never want to wax them ever again.","798":"Everytime I'm in town I hit this place for curds, beer and brats. I spent a whole Sunday watching football here and had a blast. Crowded times are a little annoying, but it is a college place. Love the mustard selections too. Curds are a must!","802":"Love Nicole. ..she's a fabulous bartender.  Always gives us great service.  Love the wahoo salad with fish.","803":"Woke up earlier this week with a crazy case of Torticollis. Couldn't turn my head to the right and I was having spasms like crazy! Went to The Joint on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday (today). \nQuick, easy adjustments and I'm back to *almost* 100%.\nToday, I mentioned offhand that I've had TMJ for 3 weeks. Two seconds of adjustments and BAM it's fixed! What the heck?! Why didn't I ask about this before?!\nI signed up for the monthly program and I'll for sure be taking full advantage of it.","804":"Nice, relatively new, Mesa gun shop in the old bank building w\/the clock tower on Main St.  Good prices, decent ammo inventory, helpful, knowledgeable, friendly staff.  Veteran owned with a modest veteran's discount on purchases.  My new favorite gunshop in the area.","805":"Excellent customer service! I want to thank Omar, in particular, for his attention to detail and personal touch to making sure my car was serviced to the best of his ability. As a customer, he made me feel valued and special. I can see why this business is always busy because I will definitely return and recommend this store to my friends and family. I love my new tires and wheels from Discount Tire.","807":"I most definitely would recommend this place to anyone. Thanx to cake world my cake for my son's baby shower made the entire event that much better! I will be going back in the future!","808":"I have noticed when 2 guests come and sit on a 4-seating table, the owner always makes it a point to move them saying that maybe there will be a lot of people who in and it will be a hassle to move them later so they shift to the smaller tables.\ni consider it pretty rude to do that when almost all the tables are empty and in the 2 days I visited, the restaurant was never completely full.","809":"RUN RUN RUN!!! This is a sham up one side and down the other!! We rented an economy car, like we have 40 times (we are locals). We prepaid through carrentals.com. It CLEARLY STATES on the agreement...UNLIMITED MILES.....I drop my husband off to get our PREPAID RENTAL CAR from EZ SLEEZY CAR RENTALS OF LAS VEGAS! When hubby gets to the counter...GUESS WHAT...she said YOU ARE LOCALS... you need to bring a bill from home to PROVE WHERE YOU LIVE...and you only get 150 miles per day and you need to pay a big fat deposit and and and..IT CLEARLY SAYS ON CONTRACT....unlimited miles...paid in full...The rude B$TCH at the counter was a horrible wench with a horrible attitude...she was just a nasty person.So my husband walked over to HERTZ...rented a car....paid and because it was in person they did a 200.00 hold (which is fine) it was 20.00 more for 1 day less than EZ SHIT HOLE NASTY CAR SCAM NOT RENT AL. Then on the contract it says NO REFUNDS NO MATTER WHAT....   SERIOUSLY!?  They broke the contract but changing ALLLLL the terms As a local...THEY ARE VERY PREJUDICE TOWARDS US...and we are a \"disabled vet marine\" and a \"business owner\" with a \"5 year old child \" with us. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE..what glitter here is NOT GOLD...it is lie steal and cheat the customers...GO TO ANYWHERE other than this rip off place...what a freaking NIGHTMARE!!! If you are LOCAL....DO NOT COME HERE AT ALL!!!  If you purchase online...DOES NOT MATTER you are screwed...plan on getting a car somewhere else and plan an additional chunk of money you wont have for your vacation!!  RUN RUN RUN..unless you like the run around , getting ripped off and having nightmares. We have used all the other companies there....this is the ONLY ONE we had a problem with...it was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  This rental was April 2015","815":"I have a good time here. I was kind of upset that my previous dentist left. I walked in one day for a medical visit and the whole office was different. I wish they would have sent an email or something letting me know. I like the new Dr. He explains everything and I have not had any issues with him. The staff is really nice. I hate the dentist and they make it easier to be there, so I am thankful for them.","816":"I like neon. Theres just something about it that says taboo allure to indulge in all sort of human vices. Moths to the Noble Gas flame, people seem to slither their way to these oasis's of the night, incubating amongst each other in a haze of sensory saturation. \n\nKelly's beckons to the person who wants to sit and have a beer, the person who may want to catch someone's eye without filtering through waves of affliction shirts over the rancor of the latest Young ___zy song, perhaps someone who wants to wear argyle and sport a mustache and still think its not ironic that he(she?) is trying to be ironic, the person who simply wants to enjoy a solid bev for a price point for \"chincy\" Pittsburghers. \n\nMe? well, I like a stiff drink and 70's decor. Somewhere in a previous life I wore nothing but polyester. More like Miami Vice, or maybe Boogie Nights. Either way, environment is always friendly, or intimate, depending on what you wish. \n\nYou cant go wrong with a French 57, the mac and cheese is all sorts of nom nom, and the tab for a night at Kellys is something you can feel comfortable taking home, even if you aren't taking anything else.","818":"This was my first time going to Harvey's. I was so impressed! The service was wonderful. The cook even came out to check to make sure we were enjoying our meal. The burgers were the best burgers I have had since moving to Phoenix. The restaurant it's self is no thrills but I would recommend it to anyone is craving an incredible burger and great service.","819":"Bad experience. There was something wrong with the temperature. We were cold all the night as we couldn't even take of our coats.\nI will never go there again unless I hear they have found a way to set up temperature of the room.","821":"After getting into an arguement at another Az casino with a fellow BJ player, I've decided that table poker is the game for me.  3 Card Poker specifically!!!   Love going to the Wild Horse Pass casino.  All the table dealers I've dealt with there are very friendly, both when you're winning and losing.  Trust me, I've seen my fair share of \"coolers\" who have been asshats in other casinos.  The dealer I had this past Friday night was especially helpful to a friend of mine, a newbie to 3 card, and taught her the basics.   \n\nThe 27\/7 cafe has decent food.  Though I think next time, I'll just order a side of bacon and an order of sourdough toast instead of a club on sourdough.  The bacon they have there...seriously...AWESOME!  \n\nFinally....Many THANKS to Wild Horse Pass for having a $5min 3 card Poker table on Friday night!  And a BIG thank you to the dealer who dealt me the 3 of a kind and the straight flush!  Cha Ching!!  Color up Yo!  :D","822":"Not much to say about this. Shattered my iPhone 5 screen, brought it in, and 25 minutes later we were back up and running. Got what I expected. Great repair.","825":"Wonderful fast service! Received almost daily updates by phone, and everything that needed to be done was confirmed by me beforehand! Price estimate was very accurate, and very do-able. The folks at bell auto were very nice and understanding, they worked well with my needs. If ever I need anything done I'll be sure to return!","830":"I have visited this location three times. The staff is nice, but they get the order wrong every time and sometimes they are out of things that should be standard for an ice cream shop (out of hot fudge? At 6pm?). I know, \"first world problems\". :) I can understand one visit being disappointed, but three in a row? We probably won't be back. We'll give the local ice cream place across the street (Carolina Creamery) a try.","831":"Came here on a Wednesday afternoon and Jessica and Kailey were amazing! Drinks were ice cold and perfect!!! The staff is so nice and are so fun!!!! Love this Place!","833":"For the first I've ever noticed, I think I was just cheated on gasoline!\n\nI was near empty, and just got a fill up here where 20.5 gallons were poured. Generally near empty, the max I've ever seen is 18 - 18.2, because there's reserves.\n\nI just looked it up, and I have a 20 gallon tank in my vehicle AFTER reserves are taken into account. \n\nThere's definitely something off here. The machines need to be calibrated properly. \n\nOtherwise, it seems fine. Kind of dingy for a Terrible's location. I also wouldn't use their car wash. It's the \"touchy\" kind that gives your car a million little scrapes, ruining the paint job, especially apparent if you have a dark car.\n\nIf they fix their thieving ways, I'd give 'em 3 to 3.5 stars. For more, they'd need a serious cleaning and update.","834":"When.she told me that the oven is 2,000 degrees so it only takes the pizza 90 seconds to cook and my order would be ready in 5 minutes I should have hung up the phone! by the time I got it home it was rubbery. (Is that a word?) Anyway, Yuck! We won't be back.","836":"No different to other reviews. \nTried the fish tacos and churro, definitely a superior Mexican\/ taco joint around in the city","837":"Omg ! It was not good at all I usually don't give horrible reviews but my father got sick from the vermicelli seafood soup! The seafood was not fresh and was going bad !!!! My pho the soup base was alright but the meat was getting stenchy and you k ow it was getting rotten !!","838":"Came here after a concert at MGM...service was excellent, food was great and we got to sit near the band members we had just seen and got a couple of autographs..how cool was that.","839":"I took my daughter to see Dr Lederman in the Glendale office as she was needing a shoulder replacement. I was told he is the best. My daughter has multiple disabilities from a TBI. She only has the use of that one arm\/shoulder. Of course the doctor knew her condition at the first appointment. He said she was too young for a replacement as they only last so long and wanted to put off the surgery. He suggested a series of  shots in the shoulder which did not relieve the pain. Then the next appointment with Dr Lederman a couple years later due to increasing pain, my daughter was sent to a pain clinic again saying she was too young for the surgery and rehab would be hard. Shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain. Then she was prescribed with pain meds. This went on another few years. She was crying in pain everyday and in the night too. I massaged her up to ten times a day and bought every pain topical solution I could find besides taking the pain meds. She cried and  \"begged\" me to cut off her arm several times. We finally went back to Lederman again. This time my daughter refused to take no for an answer...she wanted the surgery. Dr Lederman left the room and came back in saying \"I'm not the man for job. Myself or my staff is not accustomed to working with someone with a TBI.\" Then he walked out. Like he did not already know her condition from day one. My daughter suffered terribly for these years of delaying the surgery then refusing to do it. He did refer us to another doctor who turned out to be a blessing with a very caring heart. Dr Dana Seltzer. The surgery WAS difficult and the rehab WAS difficult, but we got through it as a team and she is now pain free with most of her shoulder movement intact.","840":"Denny's food at Beverly Hills prices. \n\nOne star is for the decor not the food. \n\nWorst eggs Benedict I have had in my entire life. Bacon is dry. Hollandaise sauce is tasteless and bland. Same for my other half. \nBelgian Waffle saggy. Whipped cream from 99 cent store. Maple syrup is liquid sugar with water. \nVery  dissaiponting breakfast !!!","841":"We order out at work every week and got their menu in the mail and gave them a try last week.  Pizza, hoagies, salads and pasta dishes were ordered with no evidence leftover shortly after delivery.  I had pepperoni pizza and it was delicious.  Thinner crust than other places and light on the sauce, how I prefer my pizza.  Coworkers who had other food items enjoyed their lunch too.  Looking forward to trying other menu items!","842":"My regular cleanings are smooth and I've always appreciated the timeliness of each appointment. Any work performed on my teeth have been pain free and effortless which very much appreciated. \n\nOverall, great atmosphere !!! Friendly staff across the board, relaxing background music and top notch dental care that delivered an enjoyable experience.","843":"I specifically go to this location even though it's a bit far from me because of the friendly staff and great recommendations!","844":"Sicilian pizza here is amazing, as is the Alfredo sauce. Food and service are both great. Ordered pizza and cheesy bread for pick up, and everything was ready when I got there, no extra wait. Will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu :)","845":"I have had a craving for Quiznos for quite sometime. Decided to stop in here and try this store out....Quiznos once again satisfied my lunch cravings! The worker was super polite and made my sandwich with all my customizations on point. Thank you Quiznos! Keep up the good work and please open up more locations!","846":"Not great. Food was stodgy and fairly tasteless, and some dishes were cold. Can't really ask for too much out of a lunch buffet but surely tasting of something ought to be the first thing one aims for in food.  Save your calories for something else.","847":"Hands down worst gluten free cupcake I've ever had. I cannot believe anyone would associate that product with their name, it was terrible.  Not only are all the other bakery's gluten free cupcakes superior to this one, but so are the grocery store box mixes like the gluten free Betty Crocker or Pilsburry. This was the first time I've ever thrown away dessert half-way through, I always finish or save it for later. The vanilla flavor wasn't the problem. It was so dry, that I had to take a sip of water with each bite because it would get stuck in my throat. If you're at Fashion Square and craving a gluten free treat, do yourself a favor and go to the Macaroon place. I'm disappointed, especially considering the cupcake was $5 after tax. The one star is for gluten free cupcakes only, as I have not (and cannot) try a regular one.","850":"I went in to have car detailed and they told me it would take an hour, as I was walking away the attendant said oh, maybe an hour and a half. So after an hour and 15 minutes I asked for a status update and they told me another hour!  They have you held captive because they are only part done with each piece. I quit going to them for oil changes for this very reason...unable to deliver as promised. Won't be going back for anything except my floor mats which they didn't get put back.","851":"Perfect treat this summer... Great service as well. Loved the passion fruit sorbet. Also the mango mojito was a hit","853":"As my first ever barbershop experience I don't think it can get better than this.\nHe took his time with my hair to bring it to orgasmic perfection as he explained.","858":"Super quick service from car to terminal and vice versa. The cheap rates are also great and you can always find coupons online.","860":"This place is awesome!! The atmosphere is very cozy and if you are a veteran you whole meal is free! I've been in the military for almost 4 years and have never been to a place that has offered something like that to veterans. It was a pleasant surprise. The staff is very nice and the food is great!! Definitely worth the stop!!","861":"first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned","862":"Real Ecuadorian helado de paila or Gelato!! Beautifully fresh and flavorful Gelato!. Also wonderful service to boot!! My favorite is key lime and twighlight flavored! The owners are amazingly sweet people come support this business!! You wont be disappointed!","864":"Perfect place to relax after our Red Rock adventures!!  Great drinks and great food.  Definitely try the Philly Fries.  Sit in Sarah's section!  First time having her serve us.  Very friendly and attentive!!  Thanks!!","865":"It use to be that when I have my annual vacation to Vegas with either my girlfriends or husband, Koi was the place to go to get my sushi needs. \n\nEver since I went to Social House, I certainly changed my mind about going to Koi again!  \n\nMy girl friend and I went to Social House last Saturday a little before 5, before the restaurant opened for dinner.  The host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet.  My girl friend and I each had a a cocktail while we waited.  Wow! I loved their \"Socialite\" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their \"lycheetini\".  Both drinks were incredible!! This definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have. \n\nWhen it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called \"hana awaka\"....it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we've ever had.  It was a little pricey (then again, what's not pricey in Vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new! \n\nThe food, oh the food was just so incredible.  My favorites were hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups, and uni.  All of the dishes have nice portion since it's meant to be shared, which I thought was a great concept!  The food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  My girl friend and I were definitely in sushi heaven.  \n\nEveryone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.  The manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time.  My water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as I drank some.  For someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so I'm constantly asking for more water, this is a huge plus for me.   \n\nThe ambiance was amazing.  We enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn't hear our own conversation. \n\nOverall, we had an incredible experience dining at social house.  It was such a fantastic meal my girl friend and I were still talking about it half an house after we walked out of the restaurant!  This is definitely one place we have to visit every time we go to Vegas!","869":"Beautiful facilities and excellent massage. Going back tomorrow and hopefully every time I visit Toronto from now on!","872":"I used Red Carpet VIP to set up my friend's bachelor party. The customer service was awesome and all of my phone calls were either answered immediately or I got a call back within the hour. Everything went exactly how they said it would. We scheduled for 3 separate limo pick ups and all 3 were on time and the drivers were awesome and courteous. We also got a hosted entry to XS for that night, with Calvin Harris DJ-ing so it was a crazy line. Getting in was really easy, the host texted me earlier in the evening so I could tell him when we would be getting to XS and then arranged to meet us outside the club and walked us right in past the giant line (even past the endless line for all girl groups) of people waiting hours to see Calvin Harris. Honestly I can not say enough about how painless the whole process was and how awesome all of the staff were throughout the whole process. These guys are now my go to if I need to get in to a crowded event or club in Vegas.","873":"We are so sad to see Sabrina leave Orange County!!!  We have depended on her for the past 4 years petsitting our huge English Mastiff.  Sabrina has made our lives so much easier to travel with peace of mind knowing that Kali would be well taken care of and even giving up updates and pictures while we were gone.  Do not hesitate to use Sabrina - she is really as fabulous as everyone on this site says.  NO KIDDING!!!  And if she ever comes back to O.C. we will welcome her back with OPEN PAWS!!!","875":"As a Mexican born and raised in California I'm sorry this place was horrible!! The chili had a strange taste !! We just threw it away! And bought hamburgers from B K and that says a lot!! Don't waste your time!!! \nIt could have been an off day for them!! \nAnyways as we ordered through the Drive thru I was practically yelling thinking Omgosh really!! \nNever again!! \n\nIf you try it let me know if you like it ok lol","876":"Loved the one out Rea Rd and now thrilled they are open near my house.","878":"Not a fan. Overpriced, over cooked bland burgers. Everything is extra (fries, onion rings).","881":"Did a BOGO for Samsung Galaxy S9 in April 2018. Arranged for in-store pick up. \n\nGot the phone, paid off my old one and closed a tablet line. All was good and my bill should of went down $10! \n\nTwo months later my bill went up $60. Called Verizon, said it was stores mess up. Called Store they put me back on the call center. \n\nGot the call center to submit a form 3x to fix the promotion and was denied for various reasons, the final one being the account was past due because they charge me extra per month.  \n\nI have paid it all off AGAIN and filed a BBB complaint. I don't care if the call center or the store fixes it, It just needs to be done right. I have been a customer for over 10 years this is not a way to treat a long standing client."}}
