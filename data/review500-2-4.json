Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, \" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?\" She does. \n\nMy hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard \"mmmm this is so good\" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone.\n\nSo-\n\nDo order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels. \n\nIf they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny. \n\nDo make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don't go with a date unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it's available.","8":"I was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers. The \"Man O'War\" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. \nThe only big miss on their beers I've had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  \nNonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn't had from them would be top notch... and they are! \nThe reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! \nThe servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! \nAfter another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. \nThis is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn't seem very pleased when leaving. \nThe toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.","10":"Like walking back in time, every Saturday morning my sister and I was in a bowling league and after we were done, we'd spend a few quarters playing the pin ball machines until our mother came to pick us up.\n\nMy sister was daring and play the machines hard, she was afraid of that \"tilt\" showing up and freezing the game.  I, on the other hand was a bit more gentler and wanted to make sure I got my quarter's worth.\n\nThis place has rows and rows of machines, some are really old and some are more of a mid 80's theme.  There is even a Ms pac man!  It was fun to spend an afternoon playing the machines and remembering all the fun of my early teen years.","12":"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. \nI wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. \nGive it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews. \nA bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! \nWell with it.","13":"Michael from Red Carpet VIP is amazing ! I reached out because I needed help planning my soon to be sister in law's bachelorette. It was a group of 10 girls so I was a little overwhelmed but Michael saved the day! Everything was super smooth and easy! We got good deals and had the best time ever! We booked hotel and a bachelorette package for a great price. I have saved contact info because I will for sure reach out again on next Vegas trip!!!","16":"Great lunch today. Staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients. We enjoyed the BBQ chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread. The biryani with chicken was also yummy! Fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens. Great addition to the fast casual scene in Cleveland.","22":"The food is always good and the prices are reasonable.  Although it's not exactly a restaurant -- more like a snack bar, limited menu and you walk up to the counter, place your order, wait a minute or so for them to prepare your order, and pay the cashier, then search for a table.  Kind of like a sandwich shop.  Still a much better choice for value than the other hotel Deli's on the strip.","35":"Went here last weekend and was pretty disappointed. They did not have one thing that was pictured and recommended on yelp as being good. We started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just Ok, nothing special. My freind got the lasagna and I got some special chicken dish. They were both pretty bland and lacking that kick. Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars.","37":"Dinner Was Fantastic! Service was great We started with the corn soup and the tuna tartare. We shared the Filet and Scallops. Both delicious entrees! We didn't realize the steak came with potatoes and ordered two sides Mac and cheese and shishito peppers. I thought the peppers were really hot but I'm a whimp I guess! We will definitely come back","40":"Another solid BBQ place in Calgary. This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious. \n\nI actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey\/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood\/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.\n\nOk onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.\n\nThe portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) \n\nI bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality. \n\nThe specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead. \n\nAll in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor.","47":"Very nice eating environment and the food are quite nice. Very native Japanese style.","48":"notes: 1 visit, breakfast\/lunch\noverall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.\n\nhighlights: \n- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.\n- Prime rib is excellent\n- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.\n- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!\n- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.\n\nAvoid:\n- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.\n- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.","53":"We had dinner here and the food was excellent and the service couldn't have been better!\nThanks Jose! \nWe will be back for sure.","55":"Here's why I don't write reviews for Chinese restaurants: I have to look up their English names... \n\nIt's so popular that I didn't try it until recently. The bubble tea here is really good. It's pricier than the one in Rose tea, but you also get more. \nI like that noodles with pork sauce. I've tried both the thin and wide\/thick noodles. The wide one is less chewy and are kind of sticky. I prefer the thin one for this dish.\nDan dan noodles are different from what I was expecting. My friend liked it but it's just okay for me.\nThe noodle with wonton is flavorless to me. \nThe soup dumplings are good but not amazing. If you've never had it before, give it a try and you probably will like it.\nI'd like to try noodles with beef soup next time.\n\nThe appetizers are too pricy in my opinion. I won't pay $6 for a small plate of vegetables again...\n\nThe owner is a nice guy and I enjoyed chatting with him a little bit during dinners.","57":"Took my kids here to hang out on one fine 72 degree sunny Saturday in February. Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.\n\nToo bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for. \n\nThe playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings! \n\nAfter a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the \"nice stuff\" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, \"Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?\" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.\n\nAfter carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff. \n\nSo, yeah, im not worried about coming back to this place any time soon in this lifetime. (You think?). Lol. Maybe as a duck.","60":"Sadly this place has been sold.  The gas prices have sky rocketed, some of the long term staff is gone, lottery is gone, they have run out of popular cigarettes, I tried to get gas a few days ago and the vendors \/ delivery trucks that used to park on the side street or off to the side were parked at the pumps...I am going to give it a little time and see if it gets better.  I have been going to this store for 15+ years, but if it doesn't shape up, I will find another....","62":"So good! They didn't make it to 5 stars due to the prices are a bit high for the amount of food and the location is a bit unsavory. \nThe decor and atmosphere was surprisingly nice, from the outside I expected to be more run down inside. The staff was very nice. We were surprised how empty the dining room was for a Friday evening.\nWe got Vegetable Samosas to start then ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, rice and plain Naan. Our only complaint was the lamb could've been more tender but everything was flavorful and delicious. \nI would definitely go again if given the chance.","63":"Employees were to busy chatting with each other. One employee had his head out the  drive thru window talking to people the entire time I was there. The cook come from outside and made my food. Did he was hands before making my food???","64":"This random hole in the wall is located in the Park Rd. shopping center.  I had never heard of it until that fateful St. Patricks day when another beer was in order.  After making my way there and enjoying the patio, I decided the food was my next venture.\n\nAfter my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.  \nTher service is great and they can accomadate large groups, the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.  Great staff, awesome menu choices, I'll be going back","68":"Great cocktails and very good food.  Overall first class restaurant.","71":"Heard about this place and was dying to check it put-and I'm very glad I did! Decent beer selection and kind of a hipster vibe, but $8 for a loaded hot dog and tater tots has got to be one of the best deals in town. Tons of unique toppings to pick from and delicious dipping sauces for tots (secret fry sauce was my fav). We were there early and had no problem getting a seat at the bar, but I can see how during prime time or when live music is on how it could be kind of tight. If you're going for the food is get there earlyu because that loaded dog would have been super hard to eat while standing.","72":"received a  mailer and thought okay let's go. walked in on a Monday afternoon greeted by a bartender wearing a cute  t shirt that said the bar and below that the baby. how cute however never got her name. looked over menu asked what was good she said the club. so ordered it and  yes it is good. had a beer a club on white toast served with fries and watched sport center. really felt at ease there and good music playing. will go back again.","73":"Met an old close friend for dinner at Portofino.  Great intimate dinning with class. Excellent pasta and meat dishes. Delightful service and great drinks. Will come back!","78":"ooooooh yummy.  i'm a red meat eating midwestern girl, and 9 had the best steak i can remember having in....who knows how long, it was DAMN GOOD.  the mac and cheese is a tasty, tasty side.  try the snicker dessert...it's basically two cookie\/ice cream sanwiches with bits of snickers.  the s'mores my sister got were super fun too.  only complaint is that it was really loud and waaaaaaay too many annoying veil-toting bachelorette parties for my taste.  but hey, it is the palms.","81":"I got stuck in Myrtle Beach last week and stayed here waiting for another flight.  Very clean, comfortable and right near the airport.  I would definitely stay again.","82":"#1 it should be advertised as a vegetarian dinner. For the price we paid, I really would have liked a nice cut of meat. \n#2. Way over priced. Dinner for 2 with (2) blue moon beers and (1) $10 glass of wine... $165+tip. We tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the Dark was a pretty interesting experience. \n#3. The food was Meh... I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others, but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace. \nAll in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal... Be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!!\n*** also if they don't like your review on their Facebook page they will block you from commenting on other people talking crap about you, they can not handle the truth and allow others to put you down ***","85":"Wonderful experience. We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!","92":"I've taken my kids here several times, and we've never had to wait more then 5 minutes. We go right up, sign in, and they usually call us back right as I'm done signing their paperwork. The doctors have always been super nice. My daughter had stitches done, and she was a nervous wreck. The staff tried so hard to make her comfortable and gave her a stuffed toy when she was done. It was very nice. I wish they would open a bit earlier in the day...otherwise, they're great.","95":"Love the crust on this pizza. The sauce is decent, cheese is okay, the pepperoni was not the best quality. \nMy friend ordered an everything slice, said it was good, just wished so cheese was on the toppings to hold it together.","96":"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.\n\nFirst, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.\n\nI expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. \n\nTo top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.","97":"I'm not that familiar with Scottsdale so I'm just guessing that this restaurant is fairly new. The atmosphere is great and lively but s but loud. They have a huge wine and drink list. \n\nThe food was really good, I highly recommend the ahi tuna appetizer, ravioli and the skirt steak!","98":"\"Good morning, cocktails for you?\" \nWait...what? Oh...it's Vegas!\n\nDining here, you best not be dieting because this place is literally the definition of excess, but in a good way. I'm a sucker for benedicts so that was awesome. \nService was really great too and the staff was so welcoming. It was our first stop just after landing so really appreciate the service.\n\nBack in Hawaii this reminds me of Zippys or Anna Millers - that home feeling. Prices are a bit high, but for what you get it's totally worth it. Will remember this place if I ever return to Vegas in the future.","101":"Quiet bar and grill great waitress and the margarita pizza was very good. Small sign out front and almost missed the place.","102":"They came out when they said they would, did the job in the amount of time they said it would take for the amount they said it would cost. They sold me exactly what I needed to hopefully keep my basement from flooding and didn't try to sell me a bunch of things I didn't need, subsequently their quote was 1\/3 of those other waterproofing guys and I'm willing to bet my basement will stay dry just as long! Thanks to Nick's crew!\nThe O'Donnells","109":"I used to work food service and my manager at the time recommended I try Defalco's. He knows food well so I was excited to try one of his favorites spots.\n\nThis place is really, really good. Lot of authentic Italian choices and they even have a grocery section with tons of legit Italian goodies. I had a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich that was to die for. Anytime my ex-manager comes back to town (he left for Vegas and I think he misses Defalco's more than anything else in the valley), he is sure to stop by and grab his favorite grub.\n\nParking is a bit tricky during busy hours and the wait times for food can get a bit long, so I recommend calling your order ahead of time (unless you want to take a look around while you wait, first-timers).","116":"Really happy to have such a unique place like this in Phoenix. The Tea was tasty and the interior is very well laid out. Will definitely come back!","120":"Just ok. Not a fun true busy dim sum place and I'm so sure they don't make their own food. Won't be back soon.","122":"Ordered combo 3.  It comes with two plates or rice (or bread), one skewer of chicken breast kebob, one skewer of koobideh, one skewer of barg kebob, 3 grilled tomatoes, a plate of parsley and sliced radish, a bunch of basil.  No salad.\n\nThe meat were all very flavourful, not dry and juicy!!! The taste was very good.   Definitely a lot of food for two people. :)\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive.  \n\nI read another review that they do not accept amex, and yeah they really don't.  But I asked before I paid for the meal so it's ok.","129":"After being a HUGE fan of the Mission I decided to try this place out seeing that it's owned by the same owners even though I was very skeptical that it could possibly be as great. To my surprise it lived up to what others had told me. The ambiance was amazing. Very much like the mission. Candles light up the entire place. The outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available. The staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu. My favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the Apple caramel upside down cake. They were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. They have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine:) This is a great date night spot that I recommend it now to all my friends.","130":"I've tried to shop at Montblanc Toronto several times but the selection is very limited and the sales staff while attentive, not very friendly. Recently I tried to replace a ring I received as a gift and lost.  The Toronto store was quick to identify the style number of the ring but said they no longer had stock and couldn't help me, I asked them if they could check other locations with no avail.  \n\nBecause the ring had a lot of sentimental value I decided to call the  Hong Kong location where the ring was purchased. Over the phone the clerk, Jane, and amazing representative knew the ring as well and again it was out of stock but she offered to check with head office in to see if any exist  at any location world wide.  She called me the next day from Hong Kong to inform me she found the last ring in London and it was now in transit to her store where she would hold it for me until I return to Hong Kong in a few months.  Not wanting to risk the ring getting sold or lost, I paid for it with my credit card over the phone and arranged for a friend to pick it up and send it by courier.  The ring now sits on my finger never to be removed again :)...  This is the type of service that builds loyalty.  \n\nThe Montblanc store in Hong Kong is located in Pacific Mall. Jane has since been promoted and transferred to their flagship store on Kowloon Side on Canton Road. I'm not surprised of her promotion given the service she provided me.  I will be forever be loyal to the Hong Kong location. Thanks Jane!  I'm giving 2 stars to the Toronto location, the Hong Kong location would easily have 5 stars.","131":"Tr\u00c3\u00a8s bon poulet avec la petite sauce piquante c'est succulent . Beaucoup trop de frite dans les assiettes . Il n'y a pratiquement pas de place dans l'\u00c3\u00a9tablissement et il faut souvent faire la file pour commander . Mieux vaut prendre en take out .

I went here last week with my daughter and mom, and was pleasantly surprised. Thin crust New York style pizza at a good price. The menu is kind of simple, but that's the way these places are nowadays. Friendly staff and clean simple surroundings.","140":"My family and I came in on Wed. Night for dinner we had a party of 6 plus a baby(using a high chair). We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall, half booth half chairs. My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said \"No\" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced.\nThe worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in. We live 3 1\/2 hours from Mesa and it's so disappointing to run into this kind of service, this was definitely not a pleasant experience","147":"Amazing place, full of authentic decor and ambiance! Papaya salad is so refreshing and full of flavor. Combination pad thai with pork beef and shrimp is enough for two meals.  Thai toasts for an appetizer consists if minced chicken and shrimp baked on toast served with cucumber salad. It us a must try!!","150":"Wiki Wiki is like the middle ground from your typical gas station auto wash and full service washes with the personal touch.\n\nYou start out by ordering your service at one of 3 electronic kiosks.  Everything is touch screen. They give you 4 choices but then they suggest additional upgrades to your wash.  You pay and then move on to the wash.  Someone assists you in getting your car lined up in the track.  Put your car in neutral and in a few minutes your car moves through the wash and you come out the other end.  \n\nWhen you come out, you have the option of using one of several free vacuum which are powerful.\n\nThis is a great alternative to the full service places.  It's quicker and you don't have to wait for someone to towel dry your car.","153":"Well they definitely lost me as a customer! RC Willey here I come!\n\nMy father, who is 69 years old, moved out here from Los Angeles the beginning of this month to be closer to me and my kids. I ordered and fully paid for a bedroom set for him. They called me like 4 days before the order was to be delivered to confirm the appointment. I advised the lady that no one was living in my father's apartment yet but if they could call me as they are on their way I could rush down to the place and open the door for them. I mean I live in the same complex so it wouldn't be a long wait! She said she would let the guys know but no promise...okaaaaay? I paid $1,200 for furniture, I am a repeat customer, and you can't make one quick easy courtesy call? Well I missed their delivery and no call was made. I found out from my LANDLORD that they came because they went to the office and he was going to let them in but they said no because someone had to sign the paper. To top it off, when I got my dad's key to check the place out before he arrived, there was a note on the COUNTER that said \"Sorry we Missed you\"....so they entered the apartment and left the note but couldn't put the damn furniture together?? They denied going in but how the hell did the paper get on the counter? Anyway my dad arrived with NO furniture and we had to pay $50.00 for them to deliver the furniture again 3 DAYS LATER. My father has bad arthritis and basically no cartilage in his knees making it very hard for him to get up from low areas such as couches and FLOORS which he almost had to sleep on if it weren't for my friend who let us borrow her air mattress luckily. He still couldn't get up though and crawled to get around his place until I was able to get to his place after work :(. Bottom line, they are not for their customers at all and their attitude after you purchase their crap shows it all. I will never be back.","154":"I have been getting monthly massages here for the past five months. A couple of the therapists are good, and some lack experience. As a stocking stuffer for my husband, I scheduled an appointment for him to meet with Roberta, a very capable therapist. When he arrived for his appointment, his name did not show on the schedule. Yet the gentleman working the front desk clearly remembered scheduling that appointment with me. He blamed it on glitchy new scheduling software. I was extremely disappointed and embarrassed, since it was a gift. But what else could we do but reschedule? An appointment was set, again with Roberta, through the same desk attendant, for this afternoon. When my husband arrived this afternoon, he was placed with a different therapist, who confessed that she did not know how to work with his specific shoulder issue. So he again rescheduled. This is getting ridiculous, and I'm considering canceling my membership over it.","156":"A toned down version of the king street location, GotStyle is a great store primarily for the service you receive.\n\nIt's definitely not for everyone - there is a price tag attached. But if you shop at places like Holt Renfrew or even the Bay then this place is considerably better in my opinion.  The reason - the sales agents are just better. They have pretty good sales twice a year, which is when I tend to go but sizing is obviously an issue at those times. I appreciate that they carry various price points in the mid to high range.  \n\nOverall, I wouldn't get my formal wear from here. That's just me personally. I'd rather go to the U.S. and pay half the price for the same quality. But if you can't do that, they have an excellent selection and great tailors. You can find cheaper tailors in Toronto, but at least at GotStyle you don't have to go through the hassle of finding the right tailer. You can trust the store. \n\nThey have an excellent selection of casual clothing and interesting and cool clothing pieces too. \nThis is definitely a go to place if you're anything like me and don't know how to buy jeans. My last visit at the store, Jannette spent a great deal of time educating my friend and I on how to dress. We left the store uncharacteristically self aware of ourselves, but really, we learnt a great deal in the process.","157":"Their red velvet cupcakes are AMAZING! Their buttercream frosting is fantastic and I also like their brownies when they have them. The location couldn't be better. I'd say you couldn't find a more romantic date-spot. I won't give them 5 stars though, since I have had some dry cupcakes in the past and they seem to always run out of the good stuff (mostly the red velvet) on weekends which is the only time I can make it over there.","160":"I love this place. Lots of great, healthy options. Excellent variety, friendly staff, no exorbitant prices. Doesn't beat being held by someone who cares about you, but what does? Enough melancholy from me...go forth and eat healthy","162":"They specialize in Southern California-style food like burritos, salsas and fish tacos. The decor and ambiance is great. The tables and bar stools, exposed-brick wall, modern light fixtures etc. make for a classy and comfortable dining experience. I saw a few craft beers and a respectable bourbon list. However, we did an early Saturday morning breakfast, which was fantastic. The banana pancakes were unreal.","164":"Absolute waste of money. My husband and I felt no different after using the oxygen bar, massages and drinking the $5 peppermint drink. The employee was very sweet, but don't waste your money. This place would get 1 star if the customer service sucked. And they tell you it's $22 for the oxygen, but they also charge $5 for the thing that goes in your nose.","167":"The only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because of their food and drinks. Their service however, is probably the WORST I've ever had. I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat. \n\nWhen we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was \"going to be complicated or not.\" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too. \n\nI had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service. Definitely do NOT recommend going there!!! Don't know exactly which was our original waitress but our checks said Joanne G. \n\nWill also be posting my experience on your Facebook in hopes that you get better trained and caring staff.","168":"I've been here a couple of times by recommendation from a Korean friend. The Jjamppong and Jjajangmyun are very delicious. It's even better when they're cheaper on the special menu days (rotates every other day). The portions are very generous. I usually share 1 dish with my friend. It's $5.00 (Jjajangmyun - Tues,Thurs, Sat, Sun) and $6.99 (jjamppong - mon, wed, fri).\n\nHowever, I was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (I think it's Kochu Japchae)... it was super pricey!!! That dish alone was $20.99 on the special... very little meat, mostly peppers and some other veggies. I'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns... 'cause those looked really intricately made.  I think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu. I'll just stick to the affordable menu items.\n\nIn general, I really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun), and their service is friendly, but I don't think I can come here without my Korean friend. It seems like the servers don't speak English, and there is no translated menu...","170":"Driving more than an half-hour to get to a gun range was getting old. I was so happy to see this range open up in Cornelius. They have all the amenities that you would expect a range to have for modern shooters. I come here for recreational purposes and have found the range more than suitable. They have fully electronic systems and the lanes are wide and not tight like many other ranges. They also offer memberships that are competitive to some of the other ranges around the area. Daily lane rates are a bit pricy, but considering their location they can charge that much. \n\nHowever, stray away from the touristic prices for weapons and ammo. There are many other stores that just sell and you'll want to visit those. The prices they quoted me were $200 more than several other stores and I just couldn't bite that bullet. \n\nCome here for the range and range only.","172":"We stopped by for a little shopping. The mall is nicer than most and has plenty of stores. It was a nice way to spend a few hours before heading on to another adventure.","174":"Cafe Maya, the newest coffee shop in this location. Not too much has changed, although the inside seems a bit more spacious and cozy. They offer all of your typical coffee drinks and prices are reasonable. They have a couch and a large chair as well as around 10 wooden tables with chairs. They offer a food menu for breakfast and lunch, but not dinner. They also have a rewards punch card for loyal customers. This place is usually pretty quiet and chill and not too busy, so a good place to go for some casual studying. There is no parking lot, so you have to hope to find a street parking spot available nearby which is the main limitation if you are driving. Overall a nice little coffee shop.","179":"Right off the bat, I need to tell you that I love thrift store shopping. Adore it. occasionally have sultry dreams about it. Okay, we'll stop there. \n\nSavers is the heaven and hell of Las Vegas thrift stores. You have to be willing to get dirty, to get on your knees and repent. You have to suffer through repeated disapointments in order to achieve the nirvana of a true thrift store find. \nFirst trip out - chewed up Barbie dolls and incomplete board games. Second trip - A set of Christmas lights marked for $2 more than at the Walmart they same from. But then, on the third trip back, there it is - the chimera. The unicorn. The 36\" 1970's black velvet painting of two tigers in flagrante delicto. The Elvis cookie jar. The wine cooler made out of an abandoned suit of armor. The red leather Michael Jackson Thriller jacket. A bronze toreador sculpture. And it's only $12.99. \nAh- Thrift-gasm. Thank you Savers. I'll see you next week.","181":"My family and I have been visiting this location since it opened. Can't really remember the year now. \n\nAlthough several of the reviews have to do with bad customer service, I have found that it's definitely a staff turnaround issue. We go often during the summers, and well, all year round actually. LoL. It's never too cold to get ice cream in AZ, am I RIGHT?????\n\nAnywho, the ice cream is always yummy and the experience of the kids being able to run back and forth AND BACK AND FORTH trying new flavors or deciding which one to pick It's always fun!  \n\nSadly, the smiling faces might not always be there, but thankfully, we always have a smile on OUR FACE that transfers to them weather the staff likes it or not. LoL","185":"Great environment, I loved their meat jun. Very flavorful. Also they give side dishes which is definitely a bonus","190":"Definitely a spot to check out when looking for a quality sandwich at a reasonable price.\n\nThe shop staff are very friendly and more than willing to accommodate any request. \n\nDo yourself a favor and get one of the steak sandwiches off of the menu. They are amazing. The ultra is my favorite.\n\nAlso the Cancun fries are awesome. 1 order is for sue big enough to serve 2 people maybe even 3! \n\nThis is one of the Peppis that takes credit cards as well. Not all do FYI","195":"I love coming to pastel ! My favorite items are the black sesame crepe and the green tea crepe. Their waffles are good too, but I personally like crepes more. The ice cream and whipped cream is not too sweet which I like. I recently tried their matcha batter crepe, it wasn't bad, but I prefer sticking to plain crepes with green tea or black sesame ice cream.\n\nI think pastel is a great dessert spot after having dinner around the area. The outdoor seating also makes it a perfect date spot in the summer.","197":"What a cute place! I was visiting relatives in the area and we went here to grab coffee and breakfast. The egg sandwich I got on a bagel was HUGE and tasty, but it was pretty greasy. The coffee is really good and the service is fast and friendly. I recommend it!","199":"Good environment, I ordered the famous meatloaf and it is large but a little bit salty. The waitress is not that friendly but overall I had a great experience.","201":"Wonderful cookies, but don't order delivery. Took almost 2 hours to deliver less than a mile.... and no refund.","202":"Food taste Ok. I like the pasta selection. However, there is No seafood choices at all. If you are looking for seafood, skip this place.","204":"Good fresh and home cooked food. Loved breakfast especially biscuits and gravy Small quaint place that does get busy. Decent pricing.","208":"We lived in Mexico for several years so are always looking for authentic restaurants. La taquizza does a good job.  Their menu is diverse and includes many of our favourite dishes you don't typically find in Canada.  The food is much better in house than as take out.  We have ordered many dishes off the menu and love anything carnitas and the fact that they have decent corn tortillas. The huraches are great too. I am a bit biased about the tacos al pastor since I lived in Puebla, but they are still ok. Can't miss the mandatory churros though. They are amazing!","212":"Really underwhelming flash brewed plastic spigot stored coffee, coffee \"menu\" consists of different syrup and coffee concoctions rather than regional or single origin blends or even fresh roasted beans. The red eye was okay, certainly nothing special, but drinkable. Once witnessed management screaming at kids over phone, weird experience as a patron of a business.","218":"Great food in a homely Mexican setting. The tomato soup was amazingly delicious and their chicken dishes are great. Close to the intersection of College & Yonge, this is one of the few non-fast food Mexican restaurants in the Village area.  If you're searching for a non-commercial dining experience with homemade dishes, this is the place to come.","223":"The one and only cashier working was so slow and  chatted with every customer while there is a long line. I never seen anything like it! Shooting the breeze while there is a long line of people who have other things to do is unacceptable. With all the other negative reviews I hope they get there act together because Sephora has much better service and hate to see another store close.","225":"So based on food alone they would have 3 stars but thats just not the case..arrived just after 5pm..they had a private party going on but they looked to be well taken care of and winding down...after placing our order we got our drinks and found a table...went back to wait for our food and was told they will bring it out to us...after 15 minutes and watching someone who ordered after us receive their food i went back up to the desk. ..and watched as our food sat on the counter and for another 5 minutes before they finally brought it out...and they didn't have our full order..it took the food runner 3 separate trips..heres a run down of our order\nPulled chicken..not actually pulled but diced and dry\nTurkey..very good moist and tender \nPulled pork..very good..lot of flavor\nMac and cheese..not the best but not the worst\nGreenbeens..good..the only hot side we got\nBanana bread pudding..full of butter but not horrible\nOverall food was 3 stars service was 1","232":"Real friends show up with BOSA donuts when things are awry. Their boba tea is yummy but needs more ball choices.","236":"Love this place. Great atmosphere - sports bar but with just the right amount of class. Great house beers, friendly serving staff, amazing drunk food. A fun place to go with friends ir family + an adventuruous take on the traditional bar menu","237":"Around $45 for a dinner on a Friday night.\nSnow and Kind crab, caviar, steak tartare, all types of meat and cuts, sushi, soups, Asian cuisine, pastas and pizzas. Literally all you can think about.\nAlmost everything we tried was really good. \nTheir dessert section and flavors are one of the best !\n\nRecommended for sure","238":"We found out about this gem from The Man's co-worker who used to live in the same apt. complex we live in now. It's about a mile away from our apt. and we finally gave it a try a while back. \n\nIt is delicious! The chips are mini tortillas that you break off and have with salsa. Very yum. The food is delicious! I don't remember what I had the last time we went here, but I managed to finish more than half of it and had some to take home (tastes better later, IMO). The portions are generous and filling. \n\nThe wait staff is always nice and attentive. I remember the first time we visited, it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. \n\nIf we're in the mood for mexican food and don't want a fast food experience, we definitely choose this place.","239":"Went in on a Friday since I was strolling around the Venetian and came across this place! The wait wasn't too bad around 1pm (probably 25 minutes max). This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating. However, the portions are on the smaller side so it's perfect to have lunch there if you don't want lug any leftovers around!","244":"Without a doubt,  my favorite Indian restaurant to date. There is a lot of variety, but my favorite dish is the chicken korma. The butter chicken is also fantastic. It is deliciously sweet and kid-friendly because it is not too spicy. For those of you who like to feel the burn, they have plenty of options to choose from, as well. I recommend the Thali for people who are just starting to explore their Asian culinary senses. Also, if you are a naan connoisseur, you need add Palais d'Ajit to your list.\n\nDon't expect any fancy surroundings. It looks like a hole in the wall but you'll be convinced to enter the door when you get a whiff of the food (which can be detected from a block away). The staff are very friendly although sometimes the service is slow. If you don't like to wait, call ahead and take it home!","246":"OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...\n\nThere are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value\/frequent\/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. \n\nFOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? \n\nI'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  \n\nI ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. \n\nA few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. \n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. \n\nI won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.\n\nService: 4 stars\n\nKitch: 4 stars\n\nFood: 1 star","248":"Love this place.  We go all the time.  Wings are the best cocktails are good and well priced.  Don't confuse with the terrible place with a similar name on Thurnderbird and 43 avenue.","249":"When I compare Over Easy with other places, maybe I don't find it my ultimate Sunday morning family breakfast place, but I'd definitely drop by with my pals for some home-style fries once in a while...\n\nEverything is what you'd expect from a $10-$15 breakfast, and that's why I gave it 4-stars.\n\nThe waitresses are really nice and friendly, which is the kick start of a good morning.\n\nGo with \"The Big Breakfast\" for ~$12 if you're hungry, and I'm telling you, you'd be pretty full by the end of it you wouldn't want lunch!","251":"Food is prepared fresh and flavored are great. Eaten three lunches and all were great. Service is a combined effort, so they on top of any needs.","252":"I ate at New India Bazaar for dinner. I took it to go. I ordered samosa, pani puri chaat, and gobi. The samosas were very good and very big! The main dish, gobi was really great. As a vegetarian it seemed like I was eating chicken, but it was cauliflower dumplings. The gobi had a comfort food appeal. The pani puri chaat was weird. I've never had it before, so I don't have a comparison. The description sounded yummy, but it just wasn't. The total cost was about $14. I would recommend this restaurant. I noticed that they have a pastry case with desserts. I plan to come back to shop. They  have the best prices that I've seen on neem toothpastes.","255":"The Four Stars = to  how expensive this place is.  I only saw two dollar signs for this place, but it should be four dollar signs.\n\nI don't remember what I ordered but it all came to $75.00\n( 2 ) bacon egg sandwiches \n( 2 ) other breakfast sandwiches\n( 2 ) breakfast desserts\n( 2 ) juices or water\nI'm pretty sure this was all I ordered.\n\nIt tasted good because at 2:30am we were all hungry.  I ordered to go since the place was packed from all the clubbers and hotel guests that was here.  I remember that I didn't have to wait very long after placing my order.  I remember that we all scarfed it down in matter of a minute.  I vaguely remember crawling into bed soon after.","256":"hi, went to anthonys last thurs. night with a party of seven. We were celebrating an anniversary , we all dressed up to the nines ! ! wanted to have a fun nite out ! \nthe food is good, very high end .  2 of us ordered the prime rib, 2 others ordered filet, 3 others steak, plus apps of sashimi, tator tots, mashed potatoes, \nspinach, lobster bisques for all, they do charge extra for everything... so watch out,\nwe sat outside it is a nice view..... now the bad part... our waiter, Fabio. I don't like to be disrespectful to our food servers here in Vegas cuz they do work hard, but Fabio is\nvery rude, rushed us during our ordering, did not want to explain the specials after my uncle asked a question, he said he did not know, did not bring our drinks until after our dinner was served by someone else, he was very rude when we asked for another martini and never brought it. he also did not bring water until we asked four times cuz we passed on the bubbles water, he also tried to take out plates before we were done ! the place was empty, three times he wanted to take my plate with food on it ...jeeeez..... Anthonys please he needs more training on how to treat customers :(","258":"I have visited this place several times. They have great happy hour prices and their regular menu prices are very reasonable too. Their entrees are big enough to share, my favorite is their fish tacos. They tend to get pretty busy on Friday nights, so there is sometimes a bit of a wait. Overall, thumbs up!","263":"Came here while in town for a country concert.  What better way to start our day.  Everything was great.  The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!","265":"I was very skeptical about this spot. \nFirst it's almost impossible to find good authentic legit spots on the Las Vegas strip for exotic cuisines- hispanic, Asian middle eastern, etc. If you want one, go off the strip. \n\nsecond A place that proudly serves \"Middle eastern\" and also \"Greek\" food usually misses those authentic flavors. For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli\/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion. \n\nAnd yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good! \nThe lamb shawarma was also good.\nAnd branzino fish with labaneh was on point. \n\nEven though our hostess did a terrible job, our server was lovely. \n\nSo bottom line. Worth visiting. A solid 4 stars spot. \nTrust me. I know food.","268":"I went with the ziti. Just as I remembered, the sauce was awful. The pasta was in a pool of water and the sauce had zero flavor. I just feel like a sauce can make or break the meal, and it was tasteless-- no garlic, onion, wine, basil.. Nothing. The portion was also quite small for the price. It was clearly boxed pasta and not homemade, so why so stingy? I'm surprised there are such high reviews on here actually as my experience and my family's experience wasn't great. I guess it's a decent place for families, but I would definitely go to a different Italian restaurant if you're looking for good food.","269":"We usually go to Lindo Michoac\u00c3\u00a1n when we want Mexican at a sit down restaurant, but I felt like we were just there and talked my husband into trying Juan's.\nOk, we're hooked! Service was great.\nWe got the Fajitas for 2 with Steak and Chicken, add cheese...so good, lots of flavor. Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers, the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite.\nMy only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left, I smelled like I had worked the grill, my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy. I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down. I'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here.\nPrices were on par with other Mexican restaurants and you get more than enough to eat.\nWe will definitely be back and we'll be packing the Febreeze!","271":"Service was prompt and good. I ordered the roti canai which was excellent and also filling. The chicken curry for the roti wasn't thick, I think that's a good combination as a dip. I also ordered the lamb curry (I forgot the exact name.. Rendang?) the flavor was good but I didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better. The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey. Other than that it's excellent and I like their beverages that they have a grass jelly drink and Malaysian iced tea :). Will definitely come back again next time.","283":"I love the West Side Market but I can't stand the crowds, the parking, and the general gentrified douchery that seems to accompany the entire process. For me, it's just not worth it. Enter the Food Peddler Farmer's Market. I don't know whose idea it was to plop down a produce-centric farmer's market style grocery store in the heart of Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood, but I'd like to shake their hand. It's just what the doctor ordered.\n\nImagine, if you will, a bright, airy open market full of colorful fruit and vegetables from farms around the region, rows of farm fresh eggs, coolers filled with Amish chicken and local ground beef...yeah, right. No, really, it's true. I'm not saying this place is perfect, but for an area of Cleveland more known for it's shady strip mall bars and giant cemeteries it's a breath of fresh air. It does what Cleveland and the rest of the nation needs, it encourages consumption of fresh, local foods. So what do they have to offer?\n\n-Fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables with everything from plump bing cherries to more exotic fare like chayote and California avocados. \n\n-A bakery with Cleveland favorites like kugel and kolaczki and a deli stocked to overflowing with meats and cheeses from all over Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\n-A bulk section with plenty of flour, rice, pie fillings, nuts, seeds, and other goodies.\n\n-Giant bags of peanuts, onions, apples, and carrots.\n\n-A wall of bulk candy packaged in little containers perfect for hiding in your cupboard behind the quinoa and flax seeds.\n\n-Reasonable prices. It's not as cheap as fast food, no. But if you're gonna spend your money somewhere why not make it your health.\n\nI could go on and on about all of the products they've managed to cram into this place and about how friendly the staff was but I want to leave something for you to find out on your first visit. I know, it's not the West Side Market and it doesn't have nearly the sheer volume of items of this venerable food mecca but it's worth paying them a visit anyway. What it does have is a neighborhood feel, more parking, and a more intimate experience. Support a local business, eat local foods and give something back.","285":"Great wings , and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food . I don't drink so I can't say anything about that but over all a good neighborhood place .","292":"The challah French toast paired with turkey bacon was a pretty awesome breakfast and I thoroughly enjoyed it; however, I felt the staff was lacking in service. They were very nice, just not very prompt and would disappear for quite some time.  I don't know if it was because a few people called out and they were short-staffed or if one should plan to stay awhile.  The food is very good, though.","293":"Tr\u00c3\u00a8s grand caf\u00c3\u00a9, mais aussi calme et reposant, je m'y suis arr\u00c3\u00aat\u00c3\u00a9 alors que j'\u00c3\u00a9tais dans le coin.\n\nOn peu y mang\u00c3\u00a9 le midi, prendre une p\u00c3\u00a2tisserie ou un caf\u00c3\u00a9\/th\u00c3\u00a9. \n\nJ'ai prit un th\u00c3\u00a9 qui \u00c3\u00a9tait vraiment bon, et je me suis pos\u00c3\u00a9 devant une des grandes baies vitr\u00c3\u00a9es sur un coussin et j'ai relax\u00c3\u00a9 compl\u00c3\u00a8tement pendant 2 heures. \n\nMais c'est aussi une coop\u00c3\u00a9rative d'artiste, avec une estrade etc.\n\nIl y a aussi un magasin Bio \u00c3\u00a0 l'entr\u00c3\u00a9e o\u00c3\u00b9 vous retrouverez des savons, huile d'olive et plein d'autres produits.","299":"I used to work for Skechers in Las Vegas YEARS AGO. Everything at this store is the same. Except this store is much smaller! Especially the clearance section. I tried on some shoes. And that was it really.  We were greeted, but no one checked up on me blah, oh well...","307":"This review is for just the gym facilities as I've never tried the tanning or purchased any products. There's a solid array of cardio equipment, weight machines, and free weights (including an Olympic lifting platform\/power cage combo with bumper plates, another power cage, and a Smith machine). \n\nThe pros: \n24 hours access with your keycard\nno-contract membership options\nlockers (bring your own lock)\nsweat towels provided\nfriendly employees \n\nThe cons: \nno showers\ninconsistent membership rates (my friends got quoted several different rates than what I pay) \nSmall space can get packed\nSome of the equipment is showing signs of wear (ripped pads on weight machines and cracks in the weight benches pads and the numbers have rubbed off on some of the dumbbells, so you can't tell what the weight is. I wouldn't think it would be that hard to slap some stickers on there but it's been that way for months. \noften dirty - especially the mirrors in front of the power cages which ALWAYS have peoples' spit sprayed all over them. I have personally wiped weird black\/brown splotches off the Olympic lifting platform (are people shitting themselves during squats??) and it's always built up again the next time I go.\n\nOverall it's a decent gym that gets the job done if you live in the area.","311":"This place brings back so many memories with my family. It has been here for years and unfortunately the service and food quality has gone down. \n\nDuring my recent visit I noticed they closed down the second half of the seating area which is disappointing in my book. I go here with my family and we are usually big party so they would  accommodated just fine but now we had to separate the family and sit at different tables or booths just to all fit. Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years.\n\nThe service for the food depends on the day and if Glendale is hosting a event. I don't recommend lunch or dinner here but the breakfast is like any ordinary restaurant. I was on  cleanse one weekend and they were awesome enough to give me egg whites even though it wasn't on the menu.","312":"We went for brunch. Shrimp, sushi, snow crab legs, crepes made to order, prime rib, etc. etc. Add all you can drink mimosas and we were loving it. 76.00 for two after tip. Would go back for sure.","317":"So let me start out. The ambiance of the facility is amazing.  Very classy.  But that doesn't compensate for the service I received.   I was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation.  I honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait.\nI was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me.  There has to be a Happy medium.   It's not right to let the \"sex sells\" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally. \nTo be honest I wish had just went to IHOP but I tried to be a good person and support black business.  \nThis place will not be recommended to anybody I know\nThe food on a scale of a 1-10 was a 7 if the service was better I'd give a 8.  My meal was the salmon and grits.","318":"Being an avid Hookah smoker with a pipe of my own I probably have a little more knowledge about Shisha and the procedures than I need, with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in, double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting.  They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right. \n\nMoving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere. Give this place a shot if you're near the area.","320":"Better than hot & juicy and boiling crab.. They would have gotten 5 starts from me, but they forgot my crab legs! The main reason I wanted to come here.. It was disappointing, but the flavors are really good and the seafood was very fresh.. I love that they use real butter in the sauce and not margarine like all the other crawfish spots!! So this will be my new seafood spot..","327":"Had the occasion over the last few weeks to experience their sports medicine\/physical therapy department.  Outstanding.  Drs. Anthony \"Tony\" Walker and Jennifer Hannon are a great team.  They really know their stuff.\n\nBeyond knowing their stuff is their continual dialogue with patients.  On each appointment we began discussing how the exercises were working, how I was feeling, what is working or not.  Then we would get into planning for that day and going forward.\n\nI was involved in the therapy.  And we continued in this joint planning over a month of treatments.\n\nThey administer a tablet form of survey asking about your condition and how it is affecting your life.  After the therapy has run its course you complete the same survey, so they have a before and after record of your condition.\n\nImpressive and given the people cycling through this practice it was clear that the facility and all the therapists were doing something special.\n\nGood resource for most all of us.","334":"I have dined here Teppan twice, a la carte twice.\nThe teppan is very well priced and great food but the chef's are tired. Understandable. There is not the same type of showmanship you can get elsewhere but they are good chefs.\nA la carte sushi is great. Pot of soup is huge and delicious.\nThis is a local place that does well. Service was on point and very attentive last time I came here.","335":"Came in because our Toronto friends insisted on drinking some \"gator bait\" before we left to go home. This place screams New Orleans to me, and the service is friendly just like the south. We sat at the bar and drank and we were able to see them shuck oysters right in front of us, pretty cool. \n\nDidn't try the food but the menu looked tasty, will try it when we are back in town. But the \"gator bait\" drink was delicious!","336":"Absolutely no complaints! Stayed in the Bella Suite with a view. It was a fantastic room; amazing service and friendly staff. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is room service.  Yeah yeah I know and can expect to pay higher prices for room service food, but $34 for hot tea and doughnuts (OUCH!) They charge $5 for room service, but I think that should be free.","339":"Went here on new years day to grab a burger. Got in before the OSU game started. Tasty $5 cocktails (in pint glasses, mind you) and good burgers. The fries have large grain salt and were well prepared. I had the Oh Cheesus, which is a burger to be reckoned with. Seems a bit like a rip off from Melt but I didn't care, it's a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches (with more cheese on top of the burger) \n\n\n...I made it healthier by adding spinach on top. Basically health food at that point.\n\nI'll be back!","340":"This is a really quaint place for the whole family!  Rows of pinball machines- some vintage, some modern. There are also other various arcade games like Super Mario Bros. and Centipede.  Crane games for all your plushie needs.  Coin machines to turn your bills into coins for the machines.  Vending machines in case you are feeling hungry or thirsty while you play.  Staff walks around to make sure machines are running as they should and refund you if one of them fails while you are playing.  Towards the back, there are more older pinball machines that seem to be out of order or in the process of restoration.. really neat to see!  I believe there is also a prize counter in the back though I'm not sure how that would work.  It is a dimly lit building which allows the lights of the machines to illuminate the area.. Great place to hang out and play some good ol' fashioned arcade games.","341":"I understand Las Vegas is over-priced.  But $50 for a pitcher of mediocre sangria - more than 1\/2 way filled with ice - with not a slice of fruit in sight?  ANNOYING.  \n\nFriendly staff.  My food (fish tacos) was not nearly as good as the time I had it before.  \n\nIt is conveniently located very close to the convention center so it gets packed when events are going on.","343":"There are better and worse Y's for sure.  This place is nothing compared to Dowd or Davidson, but it does the job.  I would give another star, but I've just been told they are raising the already high price.  Plus, people don't seem to understand the one way signs in the parking lot, or just the parking lot in general.  I've def been honked and yelled at for following the rules.\n\nThe front desk help are always pleasant, once you get to them.  I normally don't have the best of interactions with other patrons while waiting in line, but that seems to be the idea on this side of town.\n\nThe locker rooms are decent, nothing special.  Plenty of open lockers most times of the day.  You will rarely find yourself solo in the sauna or steam rooms.\n\nI've only swam here once, I need to get on that.  I've never used the basketball courts or anything outside.  I stick to the weight room.  I have never had to wait on a bike or a treadmill.  If I'm looking for a stair climber that can be another story though.  The bikes are no where near as nice as the Dowd.  The only thing I ever have to wait on are the free weights.  There's plenty of weights, but not much room at all to use them.  If you want a lay down bench, you will probably have to wait, especially at peak hours.\n\nAll in all, it is what it is.  Its close, so this is where I go.  Plus, there is a 24 hour Harris Teeter right there where nobody looks at you funny for being sweaty in gym clothes.  But, If somebody calls me asking if I want to go to a nicer location, I do.","345":"The food was very good . The waitress was very inventive . The only thing is my I felt so sick after eating it . I'm not sure if it's just my stomach not being able to handle it or what but I felt terrible . The staff at the front was very friendly and talkative","346":"Looked forward to eating here for so long...too bad it was on my birthday - food was good but the service was deplorable so not going to rehash this too much (apologies to my man and bro as I know they were also hoping for better)\n\nThe appetizers were by far the best thing - the entree's were good with red meat being the star. \nPeach cobbler desert was all topping that I swear was merely microwaved and had one slice of grilled peach - putting a candle on it did nothing to make me think this was the birthday dessert I was for... \n\nI highly recommend the flight of 10, 20 30 & 40 yr old ports - this mellowed out the complete waste of skin that was our server. Not sure if he thought we looked unable to tip for a spendy bill or weren't as enthralled as the table next to us with his Montana stories but my brother aptly reconfirmed his tip expectation with 7% - too much in my opinion for not giving diddley about someone chosing their restaurant to celebrate in.","347":"Hy Steakhouse is a contemporary and elegant  traditional steak house, with lots of open space and an intimate dinning experience.\n\nWe started with the Famous Cheese Toast, oyster rockerfeller which was 6  sweet and savory but very small oysters.  And the beef tartare, which was made table side and served with small biscuits.\n\nWe ended off with the 22 oz. porterhouse steak, which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us.\n\nOur server was friendly and insightful, and always catered to our needs at the table, other servers were also helpful but tended to their own tables. Although there were several mistakes on our bill initially, such as wrong food and drinks and extra items being billed, our server fixed everything easily.\n\nThe room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate.\n\nIn conclusion, the food quality is above standard, service and cleanliness is high, and the atmosphere is intimate. The food is more old fashioned, come here for a great steak done right at a slightly higher price range than the keg.","351":"First time ever coming here even though I live less than a mile away. I have to admit it was fantastic! I ordered the Surf & Turf taco plate. Both of the tacos were full of flavor and tasted very fresh. \nI got the Spanish rice instead of beans and it was delicious, not dry and over cooked like most places. \nThe young man at the register \"Chris\" was very helpful with ordering and extremely pleasant. I will definitely be coming back to check out the $1.50 tacos on Tuesday.","352":"So I once went to see Brent Spiner, the guy who played Data on Star Trek, talk at a convention (i'm cool) and he opened his little talk by telling us all about how the night before, he'd had a truly unique dining experience.  He went to Burrito Boyz.  His only regret?  Not getting a large.\n\nHe's pretty much bang on.  There's very little to regret when it comes to Burrito Boyz.  Their burritos are big and filled to the point of bursting with delicious flavours.  I usually go for the small, because the large really is very large, but I'll indulge once in a while.\n\nThey've got a variety of meats you can choose from.  Some favourite being chicken, halibut and beef.\n\nEverything is great really.  Even their level of spice, is always bang on for me.  You can request that they withhold certain things like hot sauce or jalopenos, but trust me, it's not that bad.","354":"Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.\n\nIt's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.\n\nService was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again.","364":"I should have listened at the other reviews for this place. I got the Hopeful Signature Poke Bowl and it was very bland, and didn't quite sit right in my stomach. Maybe too much sauce? It is comparable to  having salmon sushi ingredients in a bowl with way too much rice. It's too bad, because I love poke bowls and had high hopes for this place. 2 stars for the nice interior.","366":"One of my favorites for cheap, fast and tasty Mexican! It's definitely low-key and casual, but for a scrumptious chimichanga with terrific queso and a heavy-on-the-tequila margarita, this place has it all!","368":"I have a confession to make... I have an obsession with tongue.\n\nThat's right folks - tongue. I love it. Name the animal - duck, pig, cow - it's definitely one of the best eating parts of the animal. (what, were thinking about something else? You guys have dirty minds ;P  !) Being Asian, my parents indoctrined this love at a very early age.\n\nWhen I discovered that Jewish delis were into tongue too (and liver, yum!), I pretty much loved hitting up inexpensive places to nosh.\n\nI was kind of depressed in Vegas because... well, on the Strip, you pass by all these famous delis that basically rape your wallet.\n\nYou can imagine how happy I was to find the Bagel Cafe! \n\nMy hubby got the pastrami and I ordered the tongue sandwich. Perfection. Really. And not hard on the wallet either which is the best part.\n\nI did try a slice of Boston Creme cake and it is totally junky good.","379":"I have been to Vintner Grill twice in two weeks recently.  The first was on Administrative Professionals' Day for lunch.  It was packed and the food was delicious.  As is the usual with Vintner, the service was not great.  Our waiter was friendly (when we saw him), but he just couldn't keep up in his section.\n\nHubby and I also went back on a Friday at 2:15 for a liquor lunch, and I must say it was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Las Vegas.  The food was excellent as it has always been.  However, for the first time, the service (by Mark), was impeccable.  Was it because there were only a few tables?  Possibly, but something tells me that I have found my go-to server from now on.  He made great recommendations, and the timing of everything was amazing.  Sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly.\n\nPlease go to Vintner Grill.  It is worth the drive from the Strip.  Just be patient in case the service is a little slow.  Besides, you never know what celebrity you may see!","381":"I've never been to Akina for their AYCE dinners, only for their WONDERFULLY priced bento box set lunches.\n\nTheir bento boxes are all set at $5.99.  They come with miso soup, salad, and 3 Cali-rolls.  The boxes themselves are large and usually have like 3-4 different things in them (i.e. Tofu, mixed veg, main course, rice).\n\nValue wise, this has got to be one of the best lunches you can get for $5.99.","383":"Great-tasting deep dish pizzas.  They make a mean calzone as well.  I'm a little sad that they don't use fresh mushrooms.","391":"Went for Saturday Brunch. Wait was doable compare to other buffets. We paid about $38\/person which was standard for Vegas buffet. However, everything was underwhelming, nothing really stood out from their selection. For the price and to pay just a little extra, I'd recommend Wicked Spoon or Bachannal","392":"Pita jungle is one of our family's favorite places to go for a quick, fresh, healthy meal. The kids love the chipotle chicken flatbread and I am addicted to the Moroccan gazpacho! We feel great when we leave and usually try make better food choices for the rest of the day!","395":"I went here  they were about to close but the cashier was especially helpful ..but I guess they were tired of work...","401":"Believe the negative reviews. I came here after a round of golf, in order to have dinner and a few brews. The service wasn't terrible, it was non-existent. The waiter seemed to take an eternity to take our order. \n\nI ordered the Penne with Italian sausage, only to find out, they were out of sausage. The waiter suggested an alternative. I went ahead and ordered it. What I ended up with was penne with canned tomato sauce and what I swear was frozen meatballs. At $12...what a shame.\n\nAs I'm done with my food and beer, I wasn't asked if I wanted anything else, my check was just dropped off. Service and food were bad, I will never return.","402":"Love this pub. The food is not great but if you stick to the pub grub faves. You should be fine. The best part about this place is the staff! All the girls that work here are amazing! :)","403":"Very simple,  yet very tasty wraps.  Corn chowder soup was ok, but the Ravi soup was great with lots of authentic Indian spices.","404":"We love Johnny Rockets. I am not sure what goes on at this location-or if it was just an off day-but the chicken sandwich was inedible. It tasted like nuked chicken. \n\nThe shakes were the normal quality-great shakes. Servers were very kind-would have been a one star but not for these two positives. \n\nOur recommendation is to pass on this location. Not a fair example of a typical Johnny Rockets quality.","416":"After a day of shopping at the local mall and with dinner still hours off, a friend and I popped into Grazie (based on a recommendation from a former Phoenix resident) for a snack.  Didn't hurt that my hotel was just up the street.  After a quick review of the menu, pizza seemed the best option and settled on the Capricciosa (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Artichokes, Olives, Mushrooms, Salame, Ham, Parmigiano Reggian).  The pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot, with a slightly burnt crust.  It lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies.  \n\nWine list is all-Italian and well priced, with many by the glass selections.  I opted for a nice Barbera, which was poured generously into a large glass.\n\nI'd be a regular if living in the area.","421":"Had a fantastic experience dining at Olive & Ivy! Believe it or not, we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the August Scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well.\n\nWent with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed! \n\nI had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate! \n\nThe focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an \"ice cream bar,\" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.\n\nOlive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!","426":"Ping Pang Pong has always been an outstanding choice in terms of Chinese food here in the valley. What is so surprising is that most Chinese restaurants inside the hotels & casinos really are sub-par. The very basic essence of clean, fresh and friendly is the definition here, and the food is quite authentic. The servers work quite hard and there is a decent presence of managenent staff to ensure smooth operations. The XO sauce is very tasty, but be careful if you order it on the side as they will charge you for it (not exactly cheap). Still, I have been quite pleased with the food & service upon every visit for a number of years now. Definitely recommend -","432":"Great food and prices.  Servings are generous and the atmosphere is good.  A nice place for traditional Mexican in Old Town.  Really liked the Pollo Relleno.","435":"While I don't have a green thumb, I very much enjoy having low-maintenance plants around the house. It's nice to be able to walk into a bonafide garden centre and proclaim, \"I just want a plant that's hard to kill,\" without the judgment! I've consistently found that the staff are helpful and courteous. What's best is that they stand by their plants with a 3 month satisfaction guarantee!","436":"The food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts, both were done correctly. The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special, the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers, two sides, two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm....","437":"We used to come pretty frequently when it was Joey's. When they changed over to North and South, we were a bit apprehensive about the addition of bbq and stayed away. It took a Yelp event to introduce us to the owners and the ways and whys of North and South. It was great  talking with them about what's new and learning about the cooking processes. We decided to try it out again after tasting their amazing St Louis ribs. We loved eating the ribs so much, I wanted to get a smoker. But why bother, when you can save time by ordering by the pound! I've never been much of a ribs person, but the entire family goes ga-ga over the ribs. It's like a \"don't you dare touch my leftovers\" kinda feeling after eating here. The waitress\/hostess we had was pretty awesome too. Her positive attitude and the info she provided about menu items made it a comfortable environment for us. We'll be back!","439":"Maybe because it was rainy outside, or the bartendress was on the rag, but the service I experienced was ATROCIOUS. This is after only my second experience here. My first experience was in the summer where I hung around the bar (on the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat on) and things were pretty cheery.\n\nThis time I ordered from the happy hour menu & apparently when you do this, you must sit at the bar---lame. The bartendress was in a super bitchy mood and poked fun at the fact that I was ordering from the happy hour menu. HELLO? We're not all snobby rich middle-aged Myers Park folk. I prefer beer & I wanted some Olde Mecklenburg Brewery Mecktoberfest, but the bartendress convinces me it isn't good because it's the last of the keg. Great. Personally, I don't do cheap beer, and nothing else looked good, so I stuck with water. At this, she snickers, \"so just water and some apps.....MMMKAYY\" while giving stink eyes. Excuse me? Who pissed in your cornflakes, lady? \n\nEventually the order comes in: Risotto fritters, Gouda grilled cheese and tomato fondue, koby beef sliders, weird salmon dip. All that was pretty good, no complaints there. This was the whole reason I came in the first place.\n\nNEEDLESS TO SAY I LEFT A GOOD TIP BECAUSE I'M THAT KIND OF A GUY. But honestly, this woman did not deserve one stinking penny, and I'll probably never go back here because of her attitude. It's sad to say because I live in this neighborhood and I like supporting this neighborhood's businesses. \n\nI work with all sorts of people on a daily basis, and work for tips myself, and it benefits no one when you bring your foul mood to the table, in fact it only detracts from possible future business.","441":"Out shopping (gross), I got a hankering for Mexican food, and Border MX was the best rated option that came up.\n\nOverall, food was pretty good (chimichanga al pastor, flag enchilladas, and guacamole and chips) - though it was really slow coming out (despite not being busy), and the enchiladas were not as hot as my missus expected they would be. That said, drinks (including really good micheladas) were good, the guac was excellent, and overall, we left pretty happy (they Yelp special churros were a nice touch) - not an area I'm in a lot, but definitely impressed me with the authenticity - it was just the lag and the temperature of the food that was a little off.","442":"If you like thin greasy pizza, then Alexander's Pizza is good for you. The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza. The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil. \n\nAlexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. Not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard.","444":"I loved my little cake, but the owner is her own worst enemy to her business. A friend took me there because we went on a cupcake tasting that day. He said a better product was awaiting me as the grand finale. When I walked in the store, I didn't know who the owner was, until my friend pointed it out when we left. I wanted to take a look around, it was nicely decorated, but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying. I explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake. I explained again that I was not from Scottsdale and am only one person. So I'm not going to buy a large cake. When we started talking a bit more, I could see her employees sort of clam up. I had no idea what was going on. When I chose my little cake, any sort of customer service went out the window once the money transaction occurred.  She didn't even say, \"Thank you,\" It was so unusual for a bakery or any business dealing with customers. I was upset and quite frankly, so angry that I wanted to turn around an return my cake and tell the owner to keep my money. I am not rich - I am passionate about bakeries and tour around when I'm in a new town to support local business. I was genuinely interested in hearing about the seasonal cake that she was trying to sell me. I had heard through other locals that they love the cakes, but not the owner when she's in the shop because she's so rude. I give this a two stars because I liked the cakes, but the service was very, very caustic that I could not justify scoring more. She cuts people off  - that was feedback I had received from previous customers. My local friends said that they cannot build rapport with the service workers there because there is always a new person. That made me wonder what was going on. I was trying to figure out how she stayed in business, but then heard she has a contract that keeps her afloat to sell cakes to a prominent medical clinic. I love the cakes there - the store is creative, but I sense a level of stress that turned me off. If it's the economy, that's one thing, but in the U.S., customer service is not taken lightly and I will probably seek out another Nothing Bundt Cakes for the product, but not return due to the principle of how rude the service was.","445":"Having dined at many other Vegas buffets (the Wynn, the Paris, the Mirage, etc.) I found myself very underwhelmed. Everyone raves about the Bellagio buffet but I just kept wishing I had gone to the Wynn.\nThe decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.\nI will say that the fruit was fresh and yummy (melon, berries, etc.) and the desserts were good, but it wasn't enough to make me want to come back here ever again.","448":"The food is great and the prices are reasonable. They give you a nice amount of food for what you pay for.","459":"The only thing I found interesting about the place was the self tap tables which I didn't sit at. The service was horrible, my Bloody Mary was disgusting, and the place was a sausage fest ( too many guys). Also I was extremely disappointed by the small dance floor. I knew Dierks Bently was a sellout when they opened their bar in old town Scottsdale. This place is not true to country roots at all.","461":"Had a groupon decided to check it out, steak was good, server was lacking. It was busy and loud which wasn't bad but it was our first time there, so we weren't familiar withthe menu. Some of us had steak and some had salmon. The salmon came with sides and the steak did not. I wish the server would have told us more about the menu or asked if we wan't sides. The server checked in once and never offered anyone a refill of their drinks.  It felt like they were put out by the groupon and didn't want to deal with us. Prob won't return.","463":"Last year, I was here on vacation. We had a great experience, which ultimately led us to spending a good amount of money. \n\nI got a gorgeous pendant that I love. Their salesperson told me that my pendant was made of white gold. I'm not quite sure what to believe, but I love the pendant setting and the pearl, of course. \n\nThe problem is that.... when I tried to wear the pendant regularly, I found that my skin would rash wherever the pendant would be resting on. My skin only rashes with low quality metals. My skin doesn't rash with sterling silver or white gold, which this business claims to sell. \n\nI still love my pendant, but I don't know what to do now. I suppose just wear it once in a while for short periods of time... it makes me sad because I really really like the pendant. :(","465":"First I want to say that our group had an AMAZING time at Encore Beach!!!!!  BUT, we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)\n\nThere was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow \"oversized\" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.\n\nOK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria).","467":"We had a great stay at the Platinum.  I had no qualms at staying at a non-gaming (read: not a casino) hotel off the Strip.  It's a quick walk to all the action (about 5 to 10 minutes to the Flamingo depending on how quick you pound the pavement).  \n\nThe suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.\n\nKinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.\n\nI never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).\n\nThe restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times), but what was EVEN BETER was the KILLER Happy Hour at the lounge.  Every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu, signature cocktails, wines by the glass, bottles that are sold by the glass, and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day, all night. \n\nWe frequented the happy hour several times during our trip, and we were stoked every visit.  \n\nWe plan on making this our home next time we stop in Vegas.  It's the perfect getaway off the Strip.","470":"This place serves consistently good Americanized Middle Eastern food. I've had  tuna and lamb plates here, and they've been good. The flavors won't blow you away but just about everything on the menu is tasty and well prepared. Wait staff has been knowledgeable about the food each time I've been there.  Waterworks location doesn't have a liquor license but there's a state wine store nearby and you can bring a bottle into the restaurant.","471":"Bruh, I'm a stickler for good wings.  Like to the point I can only eat them from about 4 places and I find those places to usually be inferior to the ones I make with my brother.\n\nThis place is a grade A dive and dump.  It is small, old, and needs remodeled,  but the wings are still great!\n\nThey get crispy right.  And, the service was nice too.\n\nThe Buffalo  (seems like a standard combo of whirl and franks) someone is mixed in a way that exceeds other standard buffalo combos.   Also enjoyed the dry cajun.  The sirachi were a bit of a miss though.\n\nAlso, get the fries.  Get a small because they give you so many, but man they are good.\n\nIn short, take it from a wing expert...  the bad reviews are bunk or are based on that customer having bad service.","472":"Despite the decor, the food was amazing.  My dad and I had the fajtas the first night we were in Scottsdale and boy were we surprised.   Our waitress was amazing as she told us a unique way to get to the Grand Canyon, which we didn't regret.  Salsa was amazing and my mom probably ate most of it.  If I ever go back, I hopefully will go back there for some Mexican.  Was there on 2\/15\/2012.","473":"Everything on the menu has a picture so you know what you're getting, the coffee was on point and adorable foam design.","475":"The chips and salsa are so fresh and tasty that I could fill up on just those. They're addictive! We love the Paco's Taco with braised beef and charro beans. They have so many different tequilas & their drink menu is extensive and impressive. Margaritas are unbelievable. Highly recommended.","482":"I've been debating about writing this review.  I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store.  The store inside the mall is very cute.  The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).  At least I know I won't be tempted at the mall anymore.  I guess I should be thankful????","483":"A local favorite, this hole in the wall serves home cooked food that does not disappoint.  I orders two eggs over easy with bacon and rye toast.  The food was cooked to order- hot, tasty and the bacon was thick, crisp and flavorful, just like I hoped it would be. \n\nThe waitstaff is very friendly and took great care of us.  They chatted with everyone who came in and made them feel at home.\n\nOne reminder if you go..... bring cash.  No crest or debit cards taken here!","486":"3.5. Patio is great and spacious. Selection of beer and menu also great. I came here because of the more sophisticated menu variety. I ordered the steak tartare. It's okay, but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here. They use a chicken egg yolk. Tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired. Salmon quinoa bloated. Duck fries were quite good and a large portion too. In terms of fruity beers, I didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste(, but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than I thought. The seating with half booth half stools are a bit weird, apparently my back doesn't like backless chairs. Either way, I would come back if I want beer in a less rowdy bar with an interesting menu for food.","489":"Pastries are pretty good, but their iced coffee is terrible. Tastes more liked iced tea than iced coffee if I had to make a comparison, but I've had much better iced tea even. Hate to say it, I love local coffee shops, but I can't recommend their coffee. Hope their food is better!","491":"I recently visited Pieology for the first time with friends recently and was really pleased with the selection and taste of the pies. For a set price you can pick your crust, base sauce and toppings, regardless of the amount and variety. The pizzas are made to order and placed in the oven for maybe 5-10 minutes.  There are gluten-free options as well for those that need.  \n\nOverall I'd have to say I'm a fan of Pieology now and will return in the future.  Staff is friendly and efficient. It was a relatively quiet late afternoon so the wait was negligible.  Check it out.","492":"I've eaten at this location twice. The first time I got a falafel to go. I thought the cilantro was a bit much for the falafel, it wasn't what I've been used to in the past. I like a milder basic falafel. Today I had a shawarma pita and it was really good. A little heavy on the red onions so next time I plan to ask for no onions! The price is great for the amount of good you get. My pita's are always loaded up.","493":"Had a good protein omlete. Flavorful food and staff was friendly. I will go back and try some of the other dishes.","496":"Delicious oatmeal raisin cookie. Cute little spot and decor. Nice little place to sit and chat over coffee or lunch.","499":"way overrated, owner and manager have a seriously lousy attitude. Overpriced for sure. Bumpers is the place to go for the crab legs, not mushy like Pickle Bills. They have the river right outside the place so they feel they can justify the increased pricing.","500":"Food was pretty good however the prices are high. Waitress did a great job until she asked if I needed change.","513":"My wife and I participated in the MS Walk and decided it was the perfect opportunity to give the famous River Cafe a try.  What a beautiful spot and a great ambience.  We were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full.  We got a great spot by the window that opened, so a great compromise.\nThe experience.  The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good.\nThe flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible.\nOverall I am glad we went because we had been wondering about this place but I would be very hesitant to go back.","529":"Great Parathas. A little pricey. The service could be better. But, going into an Indian fast-food place, I had a very low expectation. The place wasn't so clean, but oh well. The food made up for it. We went back three times during our 6 days trip to Vegas.","533":"We've always been customers of Petco. We like the layout and the products they carry. Of course you can find some of the products cheaper elsewhere but we're fans of \"one-stop-shop\". One of our dogs comes here for his monthly wash and brushout, they ladies are great with him. They also have a woman who is \"certified\" for cats, didn't know you needed to be certified but I guess it's a good idea. Friendly staff and a great dog trainer too!","534":"We dropped by in hopes of finding Atkinson's Peanut Butter Bars(we first tried them From Honey Salt's candy bowl ) and after searching a few minutes, we found it. \n\nI was also bummed that stores didn't carry Peanut Butter Twix anymore, but now I'm happy that they can also be found at Rocket Fizz.. On our way out, wifey grabbed an RC Cola and I tried a Key Lime Pie soda which was pretty good.\n\nIf you're searching for a candy or soda pop you grew up with and can no longer find, there's a good chance you'll find it here. If only Now and Later would bring back their bubble gum flavored taffy, and If Tidal Wave Gum came back to life...The Green Apple was my favorite!......ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(3\/100) \"  Our Retro Return\"","539":"Had an awesome breakfast cum brunch. \nStaff is very warm and courteous and delicious food","545":"One of my favorite breakfast place to go to with my high school son. He loves the food. We both love a good breakfast joint.","550":"Enjoyed Nee House immensely. No service issues, just fantastic chinese food. Food order? Spicy Green Beans = Perfect!, Chow Fun (Chicken) = Perfect! \n\nJust a great place. Perhaps my expectations were set by all the bad service reviews, but I was not disappointed.","551":"In town for a convention and looking for something away from the strip. Found this place on Yelp and was not disappointed. Mango margaritas were tasty as were the shrimp tacos. The waiter mistakenly brought me the fish tacos (which were actually quite good as well) and was very apologetic when I pointed this out. He then replaced them as quickly as possible.","563":"The Venetian is a beautiful hotel! So many cool and fun things to see or do! I got a suite and the room was huge! The only reason for the 4 is because the room service food was not too great and there were some items left from the previous guests in the room, which tells me that room service does not do a thorough job.","564":"After agonizing over where to have our one upscale meal in Montreal, we decided on Chez L'epicier.  We were glad we did.  We did the tasting menu will wine pairings (note that 2 courses do not come paired) and our \"journey\" included a savory macaroon amuse bouche, gazpacho, gnocci, cod, goose, foix gras, and more.  The tastes were small but hearty, most with a delicious inventive sauce.  The wines were great and ran the gamut of classic French wines, and were well paired.  \n\nThe service was perfectly paced, with our server prepping our next course and pouring wine, and another server serving and explaining each dish.\n\nWe were able to get a same day reservation on a Monday night.  The space was about 3\/4 full, and the meal took 2.5 hours due to the numerous tastings and relaxed pace.  The decor is modern chic, and there is a bar area to do bites\/drinks.  \n\nDress code - you will not feel out of place if you aren't in a jacket - but I'd recommend making this your dress up night.","566":"I have been to ChuChai 5 times now. Trust me on this, get the sticky rice and the crispy duck! I would have given them 5 stars but the last time I was there, the food arrived cold and we asked them to reheat it. It came back to the table just as cold the second time.\n\nThe patio is a great people-watching spot in the summer plus it's bring your own wine which helps keep the cost down seeing as it is a tad overpriced.","568":"I love Savers - the deals are great and the staff is positive. There is good quality and you don't see much of anything with stains, etc. on them. Everyone has a great attitude and it's clean.\n\nWe made a special trip to Vegas this past weekend from LA and hit ALL local Savers including the one in Henderson. Almost $600 later I am now dealing with adhesive for four pair of boots and 10 pairs of shoes!\n\nWhile Savers deserves five stars, the adhesive on the back of the price tags is very hard to remove and the frustration level is palpable. When they put it on the inside of the shoe bottom, and you try to remove it, it leaves a gooey residue that is all but fun when you slip on a pair of shoes in warm weather and your foot is sweaty. Ignoring the schmuck sound when you lift up your foot to walk due to it sticking to the shoe, it doesn't feel very good.\n\nYou can put these price tags directly on leather and they don't stick because leather breathes. It's the synthetic material they use for the inside of shoes where adhesive really only does \"its thing\" leading to frustration.\n\nI still love your stores anyway but this would be a great help and not so frustrating!","573":"Food was OK. Nothing special. Its tastes like frozen food. I had the chicken breast over veggies, and my son had a southwest wrap. I think the best part was the sauces they use. The smoothie is just some concentrated mix, no real fruit. Not my cup o tea. This is a family ran joint. Which is fine, but how I found out it was family owned and operated was not fine. Scene- Husband and wife arguing about daily duties and how they cant keep doing \"this\" every day. Along with the wife grilling (no pun intended) her daughter about letting the dog out, homework and so on. I wasn't eves dropping, they were standing 10 feet away from my table. It was hard not to hear. Leave that stuff at home. Nobody wants to hear it.","582":"I won't go back. Food was, at best, mediocre in flavor and texture. If I ate the shrimp blindfolded I wouldn't have been able to tell you it was shrimp. This place used to have great Chinese food but apparently not any more.","583":"It's good. The rolls are better than the sashimi although one time we had some really nice(and surprising) maguro. We always get the hamachi jalape\u00c3\u00b1o roll and some sashimi so don't get me wrong when I say the rolls are better than the sashimi. It's still enjoyable. Good atmosphere and my girl likes the martinis. Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon and Kiku in Station Square are better. Nakama is good for some enjoyable sushi and, more importantly, the atmosphere.  You can go here and watch the pens game AND eat a roll.  Can't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants.\n\n4.5 of 10 relative to sushi quality alone","590":"I come here weekly to volunteer for the Backpack program.  If you're not aware of this program, Three Square provides \"backpacks\" of food for hungry kids that are enrolled in the school lunch program in order to give them food for the weekends.  It is a really great program and they serve approximately 7000 kids in multiple schools and counties in Nevada.\n\nWhile I admit the backpacks are mostly full of stuff I'd never eat or give my kids (chocolate milk, frosted flakes, vienna sausage, etc), I still think it is a worthwhile program and I'm proud to be one of the people that helps stuff the packs with food and gets them out to hungry kids.","597":"The coffee I had was pretty gross. The cappuccino was barely foamy, and the coffee was kind of rancidly bitter.","600":"I've never had a bad experience here.\n\ndelivery, pickup, whatever, the food always turns out good, for me.\n\nYesterday they were my saving grace, when Papa John's let me down SEVERELY.\n\nPizza Hut quoted me an hour-ish wait time (which is fine when I know about it, not when i'm promised 30-40 minutes and it ends up being over an hour like PJ's was)...and they were there at my house with my piping hot, delicous pizza in about 25 minutes.\n\nLOVE.","602":"I've had 3 other laser tattoo removals before I came here so I know what I should be getting. Honestly she didn't even go over it all the way with the laser. There's quite a bit of the tattoo that's untouched. I'll be going somewhere else for the remainder. It's not worth the pain if it's not even going to make a difference.","604":"I will say that the unsalted edemame was not expected or appreciated. A friend who lived in Japan says unsalted is the default, but isn't the way I prefer. The crab legs were not great either, but crab legs are not what brought me to this buffet, it was the opportunity to eat an irresponsible amount of sushi and then be able to complain about it on the Internet if they asked me to exercise even a bit of discretion. They did not interrupt my my unrestrained gluttony. I appreciated this at the time, but I wonder how they sleep at night watching gastronomic self destruction shift after shift.\n\nI thought the sushi was pretty good. I went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend. The selection was pretty good, and every time I returned, there was more stuff. It really surprised me that they had sashimi, which was well cut. They had a good variety of sashimi, and only one was strong (but I dont remember ... maybe the hamachi?). The rolls were rolled well, too.\n\nAs for freshness, only what I think was the hamachi was maybe off. I am sure it depends on when you go. I tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because I thought they were good enough to warrant it.\n\nThe service was friendly. I thought it was weird that drinks come in massive beer steins, which do not exactly mesh with the contemporary Asian fusion decor, which is classy and understated.\n\nThere was a group there (I think it was somebody's birthday or engagement or something) and it was clear that this is a good place for a group of people to go.\n\nIf you want to eat a lot of sushi, or want to go to a restaurant with a variety of Asian dishes, plus a lot of sushi that is not expensive, this is a good choice. I wish it wasn't in bumblefuck South Kankakee, and I hope that the location doesn't deep-six the place, but I will be back.","606":"I'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1\/2 average rating.  First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.\n  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...\n    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  \n   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w\/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.\n  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.\n~G","608":"Un genre de \"self serve\" de p\u00c3\u00a2tisseries hongkongaises. Les prix sont abordables et en plus, c'est vraiment bon! On voit fr\u00c3\u00a9quemment les employ\u00c3\u00a9s remplir les pr\u00c3\u00a9sentoirs de p\u00c3\u00a2tisseries fraichement cuites, \u00c3\u00a7a prouve au moins qu'il y a un bon roulement de produits et qu'ils trainent pas sur les tablettes plusieurs jours.

Great service, fast or slow depending on how busy it is. I ordered beef\/broccoli, chicken chow mein soft noodles, & a small wonton soup. I didn't like the green bell pepper in the chow mein (next time I will order without it). Today, I ordered a noodle soup with chicken and vegetables. Definitely, hit the spot. I added some soy sauce and chili for flavor. One of my favorite chinese restaurants'.","615":"There are two Giant Eagles nearby. The gargantuan Market District over in Village Square and this one.\n\nI would choose this one 9\/10 times over the other.\n\nThat lone other time is in the event I run out of a special shaving soap that only seems to be sold there. I don't particularly like Giant Eagle unless I'm armed with coupons. They double coupons, but their regular prices are high.\n\nBut this particular Giant Eagle had one huge bonus: their bakery makes really good everything bagels... Better than the ones from the other Giant Eagle market district, even though that bakery is huge and fancy. Even before their renovation, I would go there just for bagels. Their donuts are just like other Giant Eagle bakery donuts...really good. Personally, I prefer them over Dunkin. \n\nThe store is recently renovated, clean, and normal in size.","618":"I love NY city pizza pie.  Excellent rendition of sharing a portion of NY here in the desert.","619":"Last time I was in this area at lunch time, Chao was still being built. Now it's open and today was my first official visit to check things out. I've only tried one entree from the menu, but if the other choices are anything like what I ate today I will definitely be a regular here.\n\nI tried the Pad Kee Mao with chicken. If you don't know what this is, it consists of rice noodles, onion, Thai basil, chili, a little bell pepper and a slice of tomato in there somewhere - all covered in spicy brown sauce. The flavor of this entree was amazing - definitely something I will order again. One of my co-workers decided to eat light and ordered the chicken satay, which he also enjoyed.\n\nService here was great - Brian took good care of us. They seem to be doing well since they opened. Decent crowd at lunch, but not too packed. I like the layout inside - and the fact that they have a bar means I will definitely be visiting Chao in the near future for happy hour.\n\nUpdates to follow after I visit here a few more times!","620":"I appreciate the staff, clean facilities and responsiveness to maintenance requests. I have utlized the gym and access to wi fi in the office with no issues,","624":"If there are two things I like, they are eating and drinking. And gastropubs really let me do both at the same time very well. So they're already on a good footing with me.\n\nGaspar is a very nice place inside. It has a cozy, warm feeling, with its dim (but not too dim) interior, exposed brick and wood. Tip: you can get in either on Rue de la Commune or Rue Saint Paul, or through the hotel to which it is attached.\n\nBoth times I came I sat at the bar, and received excellent and friendly service. The first time it was Monday evening, and it was dead (and late November...and cold outside). I had the (BBQ Bourbon Bacon) Burger (that's a lot of Bs). While it was cooked more than I'd have liked (I wasn't asked how I wanted it done, and didn't think to specify...stupid me!) it still tasted very good. Cooked a bit less it could be a top 20 burger for me. I also subbed fries out for cheesy mashed taters (no extra charge) and they were yummy too. Oh, and I had a pint of beer, which was beery good.\n\nSecond visit, Thursday night and the place was much more hopping. There was live music, drink specials and a generally good vibe in the place. I had steak frites, which was cooked to the medium I specified (I was asked this time) and good, though not exceptional. The fries (aka frites) were very good. The highlight of the meal, believe it or not, was the pea soup which was so good I almost licked the bowl when I finished! You can bet I'll be ordering that again next time I'm there. Oh, and I had a house beer or two ($6\/pint).\n\nYou can bet I'll be back (probably very soon)!","625":"Great burger. One of the best fast food burgers I've ever had, right behind 5 guys.","626":"I've been a fan of Pita Jungle since my ASU days, when I lived down the street from the Apache location. Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent. I haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations, same great food, same stoned servers.\n\nMy usual is the Portabello burger. The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic. The presentation is a little messy, but once it hits your lips it's so good.  I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing.\n\nEveryone knows the hummus rocks. I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro. It's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5.\n\nThe service can be spotty, especially when it comes to drink refills, but I've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly. I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled, but I have had some BAKED servers here, so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive. So, good job, stoned servers. Maybe work on the drink thing, though.","627":"There is nothing bad in here !! It's true. Amazing bagels, bakery section, I've always loved their sandwiches and there omelets are so good. I remember they used to be in the sun coast hotel and they had some amazing sugar free desserts. I don't know if they make them anymore. Sad . But do go, it's so good .","628":"HAD to come here today because my son wanted falafel balls for dinner(I went to Costco, Walmart, nobody carries them.) I hate the customer service here but love the products. Today at checkout, I didn't get a hello but I got a thankyou and a have a nice day. Maybe things are starting to look up here. It needs to because there is never anybody in this store. They are probably busy on Saturdays. Today, they had 3 checkouts open and there was not a queue at any.","629":"We arrived for our reservation at 7:15pm.  They seated us right on time.  The resturant was fairly loud at first but once the family dinner croed cleared out at 7:30pm it quieted down.  The food and service was outstanding, and at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend Mimi's very a late dinner.","631":"Always slow service. They don't always have what you initially wanted and then they mess that order up, too. I come  here because of the proximity but I think I'll just make the drive out to a different Starbucks from now on. I agree with some of the other reviewers, the coffee is weak and the parking\/drive thru  set up is hell. Overall  not worth going to this location.","635":"I can see why The Packhouse is not a packed house. (See what I did there?)\n\nI already wasn't really thrilled about coming to this joint. I checked the reviews, they weren't really poppin. I looked at pics, weren't enough of them. And the menu looked... okay.\n\nBut I'm always down for something new and different and my homie was eager to check this place out, so why not?\n\nWelp, it wasn't good my friend. \n\nI ordered the Packhouse burger; because, if you can't do a burger right, then something is seriously wrong. And it was ALL wrong. Not once but twice.\n\nMy other homie decides to get the same thing. She didn't want the tomato jam (she's allergic to tomatoes) and she wanted hers cooked medium well. I wanted the tomato jam and my meat to be cooked medium. You following so far? \n\nWe both asked for the Mac and cheese as a side. Side note: why do they not have fries???!!! Not even sweet potato fries???!! Like forreal tho. Anyway, they bring out my homies burger and my other friends dish. They bring out my food last. There's a TON of mustard on my burger. Literally all I can taste is mustard. They killed my meat. Like if the cow wasn't dead before they cooked it, they made sure they killed it when they grilled it. And after a few bites I noticed I didn't have any tomato jam. Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger. \n\nThey were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!!\n\nNew Burgers come out, they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard. \n\nThe Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda, but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well.\n\nMy other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well. \n\nAlso we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point. \n\nThe desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good. \n\nThe oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this, would love it! \n\nSo there you have it. \n\nThe service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff, but I'm sorry guys, the food needs some work. \n\nThe location and setup is dope. The vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice. If they work on the food, I can see this place getting packed with the quickness.","636":"I like to come here every 3-6 months. I'm not huge on injera, so every quarter to half a year is enough to get my fix. \nI have loved this place every single time I went, except the last. \n\nThe (beautiful) waitress is really helpful in helping you choose a dish and (again other than my last visit) they are always delicious. Unfortunately the last time I went the dish she recommended tasted like old Chinese food (which is very strange) but I've been probably 10 other times and each time it has been delicious, so I'm going to just assume it was a one-off bad day and give it another try, because honestly the food is generally really good and filling. \n\nPrices are decent, they have Groupons available for this place a lot, so if you are nervous about going, wait for a Groupon to be available and that should cover half the meal for 2-3 people. \n\nThe place is usually pretty packed but on a week night you can usually get a seat without having to wait.","638":"The beauty salon business does well around this area. There's many! \nDimple's was no great shakes. It was conveniently located to where I was running errands, and brown (so I knew eyebrow threading would be inexpensive and ace).\n\nEyebrow threading is $4. That's usually what it goes for at these places. No taxes on cash payments! I am not being racist but white places charge more and they don't do a great job. So, always find an Indian or Arab place to go to for threading. \n\nIt hurt. But I came out looking fabulous! #worthit","641":"this hawaiian\/korean restaurant brought me back to the local cuisine of  hawaii. I ordered the meat jun combo plate and it was good. the soy dipping sauce for the meat jun should be bottled and sold in markets. deifinitely stopping by to try the other items on the menu. The ALOHA spirit is deifinitely alive and well in las vegas..thanks to RUSSEL.","648":"I've been to Sakana twice for lunch and both times have been happy with the sushi and service. Instead of creating longer rolls with more pieces of sushi they create shorter, fatter rolls. Makes for a bigger piece of sushi which I'm ok with. \n\nI'd say the quality of fish, rice and seaweed is good to very good. I had 3 rolls and walked away full and content. It's not the very best sushi I've ever had but it's a great choice here in Scottsdale. \n\nIf you're in the area and are looking for a good sushi restaurant I'd recommend you try Sakana out.","649":"There is absolutely no point in coming here if you come late or do not have a daybed.  You won't have anywhere to put your stuff which is a nuisance.  There is bag check but the lines are long.  Plus, sometimes you don't want to stand the entire time in the pool after standing in the long lines in the sun.  I saw a girl get hooked up to an IV and taken out on a wheelchair.  Stay classy, Vegas.\n\nAlso.... the water gets murky after a while.  Do you really want to go in there?  You would be putting yourself at risk for foot fungus or STDs.  If you do decide to go here, you can go in with full-fledged self-confidence because people will flaunt their stretch marks, cellulite, and other goodies.","650":"This place is gross. It was understaffed. I was given a super dry, day old chicken in my Ceasar salad. The water made me sick. I am hoping a truly do not have food poisoning but definitely feel sick to my stomach after eating here.  I will not eat here again.","654":"BRFC is a solid place to try some really good chicken. I've been very happy on my recent visits to BRFC. Our chicken combos were tender, juicy, crispy, and flavorful. We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning. \n\nPros: \n\n* Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter \n* Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating\/table options and large windows\n* Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits) \n* Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw\n   Fries: skinny, crispy, salty, and plentiful | Coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste\n* Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning. \n  Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun) \n  We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming \n* Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable\n* Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable\n* Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken\n* Honey Dipping Sauce options: wildflower, chipotle and wasabi honey flavors \n  I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders \n* Other Dipping Sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip\n* Lunch Box Special Deal:  M-F |  11am - 4pm  | 3 whole wings, fries, and a drink = 8 bucks \n\nCons: \n\n* It seems a bit pricey for what it is. Essentially, it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. You're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. However, I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. It's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.  \n\nReview 1 for 2017","655":"Pretty good for a first time. My UberEATS delivery experience was mediocre but the pizza was one of the best I've tried so far. \n\nI ordered the Mediterranean and it had a lot of flavor from all the different veggies and spices. My only complaint is: the crust was a bit dry, a little more olive oil wouldn't have hurt. \n\nI'm very captious about my pizza, but I honestly state I would order another one again in the future.","658":"I wouldn't consider this Aunthentic Mexican food, like my hubby does, but it sure was tasty. \n\n Portions are nice and price is right.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Chimichanga. The enchiladas, especially the seafood enchilada was flavourful.  I think I was a little suprised to find myself really liking the food. \n\n Its more American Mexican food but it was good!\n\nThe service I recieved was 5 stars. Everyone was nice, I noticed there was mostly teenagers working there, and they were very friendly and helpful.  They checked up on us to make sure everything was alright, but they weren't overly obtrusive to where you feel bothered.  They put some restaurants to shame, and this isn't even that type of restaurant.  \n\nDefinitely will be making this a regular place to go to.","661":"Loved the New York decor. Pretty sure the owner was working the cash register(you could tell he's from NY), there was around 100 things on the menu. For a sandwich joint I think that's a little much, so it took me a few minutes to decide. Food was so-so it would of been a lot better if the \"grade\" of meat was better. The owner also didn't seam to happy, I mean c'mon man! If your gonna have your own business love it! Don't look like your gonna kill the next person who orders a sandwich.","665":"My neighbourhood bar. \n\nI love the staff and often drink with them. Til the wee hours.\n\nGreat daily food and drink specials.  Cheap pool and darts.  Good atmosphere for sports games on one of them many televisions.","666":"There just isn't any better way to watch a movie. Sound is incredible. Picture is awesome. I actually travel 1hr to see movies at this theater.","669":"Really confused about the high star rating here...  I was actually excited for airport food due to the high Yelp reviews.  Should have dialed down my expectations?  I got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  The rice and chicken were both really dry.  The veggies were soggy.  \n\nService was great, unlike some other posters, but that did not make up for the food.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?  \n\nPrice was right - under $10 for food with tax.","670":"Very helpful staff.  Location was a little farther than the Home Depot.  After the Yelp coupon, the prices for the items that I purchased was on par with Lowest and Home Depot.  Those big box stores are OK.  However, I am trying to support the local economy.  With an adequate selection, friendly staff, and close location, I will continue to spend my money there.","673":"The Venetian is an elegant and distinguished resort and casino. Gorgeous and romantic decor and interior. On the way to your room, you are greeted by candlelit hallways and ceilings to light your way. Even though I didn't try the restaurant, Bouchon, the smells emanating from the kitchen made my mouth water. The casino was expansive and had signs everywhere for easy navigation. Rooms are huge, clean, and well-maintained. The convenience store and bakery\/coffeeshop is located at the entrance to the casino and near the elevators to the rooms which is a plus if you need to get a quick pick-me-up or forgot to pack something. The Venetian is a must-stay if you are ever in Las Vegas and will give you a dining, gambling, and staying experience that you will never forget.","676":"Very disappointing.  Overpriced mediocre food.  Refried beans served with fajitas were so hot that they not only burned my tongue but throat as well.","678":"This place was worth the taxi ride! The food was great and affordable! The atmosphere was fun and it is nice that it is a little bit off the strip and away from the chaos. The portions were huge and my friend and I ordered several items to split between us. There are great breakfast options and there is a very casual vibe","684":"I came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event. \n\nWe had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) \n- Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) \n- A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)\n- Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  \n- Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. \n- Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! \n- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) \n- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! \n- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.  \n\n***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol \n\nOVERALL RATINGS:\nFood - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)\nFood (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! \nDrink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio\nPresentation - 4 stars\nService & Ambiance - 4 stars\n\nI gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!","686":"4 stars means I'm a fan, and yes Id agree with that. However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real! \n\nSo with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy. \n\nOkay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it. \n\nStarted with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.\n\nBeef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.\n\nThe Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious. \n\nThe Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra. \n\nDesserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!\n\nThis was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!","687":"I have purchased two carpets here and went for my third today. The first two worked out just fine. You save a little money by having very limited customer service but it has good variety as long as you are good with looking on your own. \n\nToday we found a carpet we wanted and asked the sales guy to come over to price it out. It is an 8x10 and he gave the price, we agreed and then he went to write us up. When we went to pay, I noticed the price was different that the quote from 10 minutes ago by about $40. He said I needed to buy 8x12 instead because they don't have a use for the other 2\". Well, neither do I, this was not in the agreed upon price and it is a remnant so they can cut however they want. \n\nThe bottom line here is that they were not honest and did not honor the direct quote given. Most of all, it feels like they are taking advantage of people by giving a price and then changing it without telling you. \n\nGood carpet variety but a lack of integrity and honesty. Maybe it is a new guy but the owner didn't help. Be careful that the price they give is the same when you pay the bill.","690":"we enjoyed excellent service and very good food. salads were perfect as was soft shell crab and chicken livers. broad pasta was excellent as was scottish beef. very good and extensive wine list. wonderful experience and good value for the price","692":"I honestly didn't find this place to be all that.  Don't get me wrong its a nice modern place but I can find better made items that Honey Salt offers for way cheaper price.  The only good thing that I was blown away by is their Fried Calamari.  That was a pretty legit dish.  Their biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich I believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better.  We also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap \"free range\" chicken breast that was grilled.  Overall not too impressed with what they served.  And this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn't care for us.  Everyone else had bread on their tables but us, don't know if you had to order it or not.  \n\nAgain, overall the place is well lit and looks great.\n\nFoodwise....id go somewhere else.  As a local i should've known better but wanted to try something new.  Now i know, i won't go back.  There are other places around town to get same food for cheaper price and same quality. Good luck.","697":"Bought a bow here. They have nice equipment. But, the staff member I worked with seemed like he didnt have time for me and any questions i had. I got a too cool for school kind of vibe here. Should have purchased elsewhere and i wont be going back. Told my close friend to take his $1200 bow purchase elsewhere. Sportsmans warehouse has much friendlier customer service.","706":"Yet another example of a business cashing in on location at the expense of quality. Cocktails are chain-restaurant worthy, wine list is weak, and seafood is only barely competently prepared. \n\nCalamari was good. Worth it, served with a large pool (at least 2 cups) of seasoned mayo. \n\nLobster roll was rubbery and tasteless. The bun was exceptional however. The salmon was Kirkland's best, and \"crusted with pecans\"=sprinkled.  Hmm. The grouper sandwiches were passable. McCain fries. Yum. \n\nThe day was sunny. The company was excellent. I noted the The Pump ouse Grill on Lakeshore. I'll park there next time and enjoy the wings.","708":"Remember 98 South Wine Bar?... or the 2nd 98 South Wine Bar?... or Fat Cat?  That space in Downtown Chandler has a new tenant, and they seem like a keeper.  DC Steak House is a rarity in Phoenix; a mid-priced, independent steak houses in a sea of chain restaurants and a la carte wallet busters.\n\nLooks:  Well, it does look fairly similar to the previous restaurants, except they changed the bar area and the art.  I like it.  It's elegant and not too dark or too partitioned.  There's a mural on one wall that I think the owner painted.  The place is a nice addition to Downtown, which is still fighting off the urban sprawl of mega-chains.\n\nCrowd:  Seemed happening, although it was Opening Night.  A wide mix of young and old.\n\nFood:  My eye was drawn to the large selection of fish, but I decided to go with steak at a steak house.  The salad was solid.  I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it.  Bread was OK.  My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms.  My friend ordered the walleye.  I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota.  Maybe that was a fish story.\n\nValue:  Here's where I thought this place shined.  Meals were in the $18-30 range, including salad and potato.  They have $10 sandwiches, too, but they're not served on Fri\/Sat until after 9pm.  Seems fair.\n\nService:  Service was slow, although it was Opening Night.  They also screwed up my friend's appetizer, serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce.  However, the people could not have been nicer.  The owner apologized and bought us desserts.  (Chocolate Decadence Cake was delicious, although a little rich for my taste.)  Then, the chef came out , shook our hands, and bought us drinks.  I felt like I was in a place where people would remember my name, even though they surely won't.\n\nMiscellaneous:  A lot of decisions haven't been made yet.  Will they serve lunch?  What will they do for happy hour? (a crucial decision in my mind.)  Even the menu will likely vary in the coming months.\n\nVerdict:  I don't go out for steaks often, even reasonably priced ones, but I'll definitely be back to DC Steakhouse to see my new \"friends.\"  I've got my eye on the steak sandwich for next time.","710":"I love Mexican food.  I live across from the Fajita Grill.  I have only been there twice (in 4 years).\n\nAs many of the other reviewers have said, the food is sub-par Mexican food.  I appreciated the complementary chips and salsa, and the incredibly unhealthy Boat Dip was pretty decent.  I had the Tofu Mexicana, which was mushy tofu and overcooked vegetables.  As hit or miss as Mad Mex can be, since it opened I have been there more times than Fajita Grill. \n\nIt is BYOB, but when I eat Mexican I want an ice cold margarita.  They also charge for sharing plates ($2.50) and ask that you split your check prior to ordering.","712":"I had the country fried steak and would recommend it.  It's pretty small in the dining area, so I would not recommend a group larger than 4, even so 4 is pushing it.  Knocked off 1 star for cash only.","714":"This is just a great little find with great N'Orleans-style food. Had the blackened trout. Mr. Bill had crayfish. Shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes. I normally don't care for collard greens, but they were delicious. You have to try the bread pudding, if you have room. Pleasant staff. Good food. What more can you ask for! Oh, yeah, great variety of libations. Thank you for a new Tega Cay eatery that's good!!","715":"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?\n\nThere are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the \"membership line\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  \n\nThe second line, is to \"check in\" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  \n\nBoth of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  \n\nAfter all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  \n\nThen, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  \n\nWe head to our bay with a \"bay concierge\" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  \n\nWe start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a \"slider\" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.\n\nWhen the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\"  The server leaned in all interested.... \"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \"could we have napkins?\" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.\n\nSo, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.\n\nThe kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  \n\nOK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   \n\nAgain, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.","716":"I tried Nichiban for the first time, and I definitely have to agree with the reviews from the other users for this restaurant.  It's a very small place, tucked in a little corner of a small plaza right across Pacific Mall at Steeles\/Kennedy, but the food is delicious.  Being a big fan of salmon sashimi, I asked if the sashimi bento and other main courses containing sashimi, can be replaced with all salmon sashimi and yes, it can be done.  I had the salmon sashimi bento box accordingly, and I have nothing but praise for the quality of the sashimi and the taste of the tempura, spicy salmon sushi and even the salad that accompanied the bento.  \n\nThey even gave us a huge plate of grilled salmon pieces, all on the house - also quite yummy!  The only aspect that they can improve is to add a little dessert at the end, such as green tea ice cream like many other little sushi restaurants tend to do, however I am very content with this place just as it is.  I will definitely be returning to this place whenever I am in the area.","722":"Fantastic time here!  I was so on the fence about my dress until I found one that I loved and happened to be one of Rachel's favorites, too. She gave great service, was incredibly helpful, very clear on my options for altering the dress, and was amazing with suggestions while taking my venue and overall style into consideration.","726":"FIrst let me explain the 2 stars - we decided to try out the sushi after friends said it was good.\nWe got to Smokin Fins at 6:30 pm thinking we had plenty of time before the Happy Hour menu was over at 7:00 pm. But the wait list was 40 minutes long and we did not get seated until 7:10 pm. Since Happy Hour was over we did not get Happy Hour pricing even though we were waiting on the list for 40 minutes. Left a bad feeling about the service and management. I heard a few other couples expressing their opinions about the same thing but management just said \"Sorry\"  Now for the good part. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was relaxing inside and outside. The food presentation was impressive.  Service was just OK. The sushi was cut very think and cooked just perfect. If our dinners were not so good we would not return. Since the food was so good, we will give Smokin Fins another chance on our next sushi craving.","727":"Egg-celent! Was so delicious and would definitely recommend it. I gave only 4 stars because I wish they had more options on their menu. I didn't want bread and opted for the salad at no additional cost. Although the salad was good, I'm not too sure about arugula with scrambled eggs and a slice of cheddar cheese.","730":"Good spot to satisfy a late night Korean craving! Hot bubbling gam ja tang hits the spot on a cold night. Seating was comfortable, service was a little lacking but courteous. Could do with more sides! All in all a good place if you're looking for straightforward comfort food.","735":"This review is difficult to write because it is so mixed.  The floral department is one of the best.  Greg in the meat department is extremely helpful, the management there is horrible.  The store certainly does not represent what Safeway should stand for.  I live in Goodyear part of the year and in San Ramon, California part of the year, they have a state-of-the-art store in San Ramon, one which would rival any speciality grocery store, so I know they can do it, the one in Goodyear is just horrible by conparison.  Often the food is even old.  The people are generally nice, but the management of Safeway needs to do a major update here and fix this store.","743":"This place looks hopeful on the outside but is actually pretty bad. My maple glazed salmon was very burnt and lacked flavor. The asparagus it came with was pretty disgusting and soggy. The waitress was great and the side Caesar salad I had was good. The experience was horrible simply due to the blasting crappy music as well. Probably don't eat here.","744":"This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus \"tapas\" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the \"Halal\" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant. In the meantime go and see Amer and get a taste sensation fix...tell him Nick sent you!","746":"Everything was pretty good but the beef in the Mongolian beef was very chewy and had a weird texture. I know this is always a 50\/50 chance when trying a new Chinese restaurant. The rest of the food was very good! Their noodles are really good and the fried rice.","747":"Adult grilled cheese?  Novel concept.  The food was good (not great).  The wait was long - prepare for a long wait, this place is always packed!  The bread is quite greasy, but the innards were excellent, along with gigantic portions.","748":"Okay, so, we had a full meal here, with drinks, for less than $20. Can somebody say Value?!\n\nWe came here for brunch on a Saturday around 10:00 AM, and it was relatively full. We ordered: the Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice ($6.50), the Malaysian Street Style Sandwich ($5.99), soy milk tea ($1.80) and the hot honey lemon juice ($1.80). The Malaysian Curry was delicious but really, really oily (you could literally see the pools of oil gathering on top of the bowl). If you're fine with that (which I was), you'll probably still enjoy it. The sandwich was our highlight - it really filling but still super light and tasty (the bread was white toast, crispy and buttered). It was stuffed with everything it promised, but it didn't make you feel gross afterwards. With the tea, it was a great, comforting Saturday morning meal!\n\nLocated right beside the Erindale GO Station in the same plaza as Sushi Tei, Chili Chicken House, and Wonton Chai Noodle (among others), on the northwest corner of Creditview and Burnhamthorpe, and a few minutes away from the Mavis exit of Highway 403, this place really gives you bang for your buck. Plus, the food is delicious, prepared fresh. Overall, a really enjoyable meal. \n\nOur total with tax was around $18.00. With tip, we paid around $21.00. A great, go-to cheap eat in Mississauga where the food is actually decent! Will be back.","753":"Excellent chaat, okish biriyani, great service. Fresh food. The place is very clean and lively. Unlike the other Indian restaurant s we visited which were so dead!","757":"Got a pepperoni and sausage half sheet pizza from here last weekend and it was delicious. The pepperoni was awesome! The sausage pieces are huge like small meatballs. The sauce is thick and sweet which I like. Tons of cheese on this pizza which caused me to have an upset stomach aftward. Not their fault. I didn't go into the building to pick up the pizza so I can't say what it's like to eat in.","760":"Greasy unappetizing fried food. Low quality ingredients. Pretty much tastes all the same.\n\nNever again.","763":"Second time I have been here,  and the only reason I took a star away,  was because I had to toss my entire takeout dish except the cookie!! I very specifically made sure to say NO BEANS.... Unfortunately,  my food was covered in them!  The service here is very very good... They know their menu and will walk you through finding the order right for you.   The food is very good,  was looking forward to it...  Looks like totinos is lunch today!!","764":"I've heard great things about Toast for breakfast and lunch so thought we might get it a try for dinner...  We walked in around 6:30pm on a Friday night,  the restaurant was about half filled. There were plenty of seats in the the front of the restaurant but our party of four was seated in the very back beside the bathrooms and back door.  We sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat)  but  we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits.  We politely ask if we could move to the front.  The hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it.  The same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) .  \nWe were brought a loaf of soft bread to table, pretty tasty but the butter is a little different.  It is a sweet butter with orange zest.  \nWe were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish I happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli,  my husband the lasagna, our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat), and chicken Marsala with ravioli side.   The server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us...... so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side. When our  meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered.  He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom). \nI was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good. My husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! I could only eat a couple bits, he couldn't finish it.  My mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless. The cream sauce was very watery. I did not enjoy my main dish at all.  \nOn the bright side though, we all got salads and really enjoyed them. I had the small blue wedge salad. It was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top. Really good! \n Our server disappeared  while we were eating our meal.  The lady who had been refilling our waters took over our table and closed our checks.  As we were leaving, we see our server  sitting behind the bar, playing on his phone and chatting with other guests....\nWe probably will not be returning to Toast for dinner. It just seemed way to pretentious and we were not impressed by the food or the 93.5 sanitation grade.","765":"This is always a must visit on vegas trips.  I've had the St. Louis crepe (ham and cheese) and Nutella (peanut butter and banana). Yumm this place is consistently delicious every time.  The 20 minute wait is worth it for these crepes, just try and find a table early on since the seating is shared with the caf\u00c3\u00a9 next door. Seems a little pricey at about $10 but what isn't pricey in Vegas?","772":"Im giving this place four stars more for sentiment than taste, but their food is decent. The falafel and gyro sandwiches are both on the small side but tasty and made in a flash. They have basic middle eastern groceries as well as a few hot dishes and classic desserts such as baklava and cashew fingers. A great place to get feta, dolmas , tabouli, or hummus. The baba ganouj is excellent.","779":"Decent dim sum but it's expensive.\n\nA pot of tea costs money and they automatically add the gratuity to the bill.\n\nTake the walk up to Dundas and Spadina for better prices.","780":"Love this place! It's simple. It's priced fair and the waffle was very good. Sunday was my day to say I have had enough of the twigs and berries and I want pancakes! Well at least a waffle although they have big banner that states now serving pancakes but really who goes to a Waffle Cafe for pancakes...the name tells you what their specialty is. \n\nAnyway I had a waffle with blueberries, strawberries and bananas. No I passed on the chocolate chips, whipped cream and powdered sugar. Hey I was breaking lose on my food choices but didn't want to go crazy...maybe that why I was carving ribs later that night because I knew I had saved some food karma points :)\n\nAlso the staff in this place was very friendly, helpful and fun. It was good to hear youthful energy enjoying their work instead of the normal this is just my job type of employee's. This staff gave good service and enjoyed what they do. \n \nI would definitely come back here good food, good service and fair prices. Oh and I forgot to mention they also have cool smoothies I got the Lychee...yum I love the fruit!","781":"Good food all around. The meal begins with complimentary sides as most Korean restaurants are known for. In addition to the usual sprouts, kimchi, etc. Island Style also gives you boiled peanuts which were a nice touch. I went wth cold noodles half and half for my meal. I really liked the dish, with each side offering a nice taste. I wish it could have been spicier but in the end I was contently full and very happy with my choice. $14 for the dining experience was well worth it. The restaurant itself had a very mom and pop feel and seemed authentic in every aspect. A very good option for eating in the area.","786":"We love Barnes and Noble but this store does not deserve to carry the name.  It's a terrible representation and if Barnes and Noble cares anything about their brand reputation they should get to this story immediately and clean it up!  Please start in the bathrooms!  Horrendous!","787":"\"I would give the location 5 stars and the restaurant 3, so we're at 4 stars overall.\nI went with hubski and a couple of friends for a nice weekend picnic. The experience would have been a 5-star one if we had brown-bagged it, but as it was, we purchased food from the quaint little house-converted-to-restaurant. Hubski and I shared a veggie sandwich and a peach pie thing. Tasty, but most definitely overpriced. The iced tea was tasty and refreshing, but still, sharing a meal with a drink each, it should have been less money.\nI'll go back for the ambiance. It's definitely kid and dog friendly, but we'll bring a big blanket, some kid toys, a dog or three, and lunch in a brown bag... we'll still buy pastries though.\"","788":"As far a dunkin donut locations I have been to better. It's close to where I am staying for my birthday week and I have the app with a few free coffee rewards. That is the main reason I came to this location 2 days in a row. First day there was no line but I had to wait since I ordered a smoothie that apparently only one person knew how to make. And of course they were busy. Day two I decided to go simple and got a large coffee with two donuts. Coffee order was right but they gave me the wrong donuts","791":"We got the chicken club and the prime rib dip!!! French fries and side salad!! It was yummy!!!!!!:) Only problem was not a kids menu. They will make a few items for the kids!!! The chicken tenders... The kids did not like them... Not your normal kid friendly kid coating!!!","794":"My kids had an absolutely blast playing here! Lots of fun! My only suggestion would be more comfortable seating for the parents. The more comfortable the parents are the longer the kids can stay & play.","795":"Very nice little casual eatery.  Intimate setting but very flavorful dishes.  I tried the chicken shwarma and it was delicious.   Great prices and the service was reasonably quick as well.","796":"I normally don't like fancy cupcakes because they consist of half icing in volume, and I'm not a big fan of frosting--it's too much like eating heavy, creamy sugar. This place, however, has light and fluffy icing that I actually looked forward to biting into all on its own. Amazing.","797":"2015 St. Patrick's Day Festival highlights: Saturday morning parking was available for free at 1) Parking Garage near City Hall, located at Basic Road and Lead Street.

Led by Debbie Carroll and Shelley Locklier, the two dancers have Irish dance teaching credentials; both teachers travelled the world with Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance.\n\nFun for the children included the ferris wheel and carousel.  Since the Las Vegas Valley does not have a permanent ferris wheel and carousel to ride, we enjoyed taking a twirl on both.  Ferris wheel tickets were 4 tickets per person. Carousel tickets were 3 per person, but an adult is free if standing next to small children who are on the ride.  Each ticket = $1.25.\n\nI would like to see a greater use of food trucks.

Yes, it feels like you are in someone's basement, but not in a \"it rubs the lotion on its skin\" kind of way.\n\nDrinks are reasonably priced. Bottled water only. The menu is your typical bar food, but pretty decent bar food at that. Service is good. I've yet to have a bad experience.\n\nThe venue set up is great. There is seriously not a bad seat in the house. You can pick yours online when you buy tickets. \n\nThe local opener will always be hit or miss. The headliner(s) will be worth the price of admission.\n\nIf you're looking for something different to do, I recommend checking the Comedy Zone calendar and catching a show.\n\nMy personal must-see list: (I make sure to go every time these guys are in town)\n\nBill Burr (He sells out pretty much every time. Buy immediately when announced)\nJosh Wolf (you know him from Chelsea Lately, Shark After Dark)\nPauly Shore (warning: filthy language)","800":"I'm never disappointed picking up a slice at Desert Ridge slices - the kids love  it, and I'm a fan of the NYC triangle slice too. Plus, I pick up all my weekly magazine reads in their shop as well.","801":"The reason I did not rate a 5 is because the staff is not the best with designs. I like to have designs on my nails and they were very hesitant to do any of the ones I wanted. They ended up doing a Hawaiian flower on my toes. Its was ok but not the best. \n\nI was very impressed by the cleanliness of the salon. They have a large polish selection. My nails have lasted a long time and that means a lot to me. \n\nThey were very friendly and humorous there! They all used English talking to patrons and with each other, which was great! \n\nI think the prices were great for the Waxhaw area. I paid $57 (without tip) for a full set French manicure with sparkles, and pedicure with design. I used to pay $75 for the same service at my last salon. \n\nI will definitely go here again. I would recommend making an appointment. It was a Saturday when I went and they were turning people away.","806":"I have purchased potted herbs here before and have been less than impressed- gnats\/root rot are commonly seen upon close inspection and I have to dig around to find a few to take home.\n\nThis place is a bit of a drive for me and I wanted to be sure they had what I needed in stock before I drove down on a hot day. I called to ask about a specific kind of planter pot in stock, waited about 5 minutes only to have my call picked up and ended. I called back again and waited another 5 minutes for someone to tell me they had that type of pot in stock but couldn't give me any specifics on a general price point. Star Nursery IS pricier than other places, such as amazon and Home Depot\/Lowe's. So when he told me they were \"pretty cheap\", I had to take it with a grain of salt.\n\nMy seedlings can wait a couple of days for an Amazon shipment. I can't patron this place this time around but maybe I'll continue to come back in the future.","810":"This place is over the top! The food is great and the portions...when the hell did every restaurant in Vegas begin serving only sumo wrestlers. My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. \n\nThis place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. \n\nMy only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either. She gave me a look like, do you still want in or not, I have other people to be rude to.","811":"Food is good but service is always lacking.  35 minutes wait time for lunch is unacceptable especially when you only have an hour for lunch.","812":"Nice enough theatre, but not a great overall experience.  Only one person working the ticket counter at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Long line to get tickets meant standing outside in the sun.  No kiosks.  Screen, sound and chairs were good.  Way too hot.  I've never walked out of a theatre with swamp ass before.  10 mins of commercials prior to the \"start time\" followed by another 30 mins of previews.  Talk about pinching pennies and squeezing every ounce of profit out of the movie experience.  I'd liken it to one of those free iPhone games with adds running constantly.  Cheap. Cheap.","814":"Tuesdays are 30% off seniors 60 and over. That is a huge saving. If I see something a few days before that I like, and is still around Tuesday it's an extra bonus.  You must tell the cashier you are a senior before cashing out, or they  will not apply the discount. Transaction has to be voided and well... so just tell them right away.  I like this location. Some of the house ware merchandise is pricey. It makes no sense and needs to be addressed. Wouldn't it be nice if one day they wold throw in a \" free book of your choice \" with purchase of $5.00 . Too many books on shelves that don't move.  I see students, seniors, family with children who may be on a budget or getting by,  why not have a  \" no tax \" day it makes a difference.  Have fun and take some time to sift through the racks .  Some days you win some and other days you don't.","817":"Some notes: restaurant is located in the Esplandade with the AMC cinema and to the east of the Ritz Carleton.  Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it's tough to find.  Don't give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.  \n\nThat being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We're from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN'T like Groupon-ers.\n\nGreeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as \"XL\".  He's just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.  \n\nNice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!\n\nTROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.\n\nDrinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!\n\nEntrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH's was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.\n\nI'd like to say how wonderful DH's meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!\n\nWas my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.\n\nHuge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him, hahaha!\n\nBonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who's lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn't live in the City, but I love visiting the City 'cause you meet the most interesting people!\n\nSo at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had \"hid\" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.  She took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  Not nice.  (BTW, Fuego del Mar entrees from $20-$25)\nFor sure, we will be back.  It's a field trip for us, but worth it.  Just an all-around good experience.","820":"Pretty big portions, good for family style. \nWalnut shrimp's is 90% batter and 10% shrimp.\nRecommend the fish filet and jelly fish.","823":"Excellent for Take-out or Delivery.\n\nThe food is authentic. The ingredients are incredibly fresh - a necessity in Thai cuisine.\n\nThe pad thai is perfect, the green and red curries are consistent and delicious. \n\nEating in, however, avoid it! The decor is dated and tacky, not a pleasant environment to dine, although the servers are all pleasant.","824":"Nice way to spend the morning...relaxing by the pool enjoying breakfast at the Terrace Pointe Caf\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nService was great.  Food was delicious. \n\nPlease bring back the Lobster Eggs Benedict & the Wynn Sunrise Juice to the menu!!!","827":"Tacos were good, service was good. Neither were great. I've been here twice and I like the tacos and the sauce caddie. Oh my god why did you rate it so low? It's a Mexican restaurant and they had nothing spicy. Nothing. I asked and I was greeted with a shrug. I asked other employees, another shrug. \" you mean you have no spicy salsa, sauce, nothing spicy!!!\" \" no sorry sir this is Scottsdale\". I'm not a spicy freak to be clear. They don't have Tabasco or anything even close to being hot. They have  \"habanero oil\". When I asked if it was hot the sever told me \"only if you think vegetable oil is hot cause that's what it is\" she was telling the truth. Literally! I'll pass next time.","828":"First, I love barbecue so. Second, I love any place that serves you a pile of meat on a tray. I am a simple creature. \n\nNaked BBQ was fun, fast, and tasty. The staff was ridiculously nice and fun. As for the food, the sides are bit lackluster and need a bit more of a spicy punch or additional creamy, fatty goodness.  But, that is totally okay as the meat is the real star here. We tried four options, and we agreed that we both liked the brisket the most. Pulled pork and chicken were tasty as well. Overall, it was a fun, casual lunch with the before mentioned meat on a tray. I would totally stop by here for lunch or a brisket pick-up adventure again.","829":"This was my first time here. I tried the salmon enchiladas with brown rice and Cajun beans.\n\nSalmon is a tricky fish as I have mentioned in previous reviews. I was happy to taste well cooked and tender salmon. The red enchilada sauce was spicy, but not unbearable. \n\nThe Cajun beans were also spicy but tender. They were made with white beans. These beans had the right kind of tenderness to indicate they were not canned beans.\n\nThe brown rice was regular wheat rice. This is a great place for some Baja fish.","835":"So, this is actually not my first time here... came here a few times already and food is pretty good.  No complaints at all.  You come here for the curries and their rotis.  \n\nWe ordered the beef brisket curry, a fried rice and 2 extra orders of roti.  I wish there was just a bit more beef in the curry.  Other than that, things were pretty good.\n\nA little on the expensive side.  The portions were a bit small for the prices they are charging.  I guess they can get away with it, their food is pretty good after all.\n\nWill I come back...  yes.  But will not go out of way to come here.  I don't usually have cravings for curry (never did).  \n\nI am always finding things on the small side lately... no idea why!","848":"Sexy, swanky Art Deco\/Craftsman interiors with nightly piano.\nSerene patio seating for fireside canoodling, sunset viewing or enjoying the early desert spring weather.\nService was attentive, quick and friendly.  The sunset margarita was a fruity and refreshing retreat and went perfectly with my awesome chicken quesadilla.\nIf I wasn't at the Biltmore for work you would've found me here or at the pool my entire stay in Phoenix.","849":"Frankly disappointed. Guy is one of my favorite chefs i know, he's so cool and i love his since of humor. but his menu is lacking to me. its so concentrated which can be good... if the quality can hold up to it. i got the bacon cheese burger and i could have gotten the same thing at half the price 3 blocks down the strip. seasonings were bland and LOTS of grease. the reason your getting 3 starts Guy is because I'm more the sure this restaurant doesn't represent you very well.","852":"Had them last night. Great morning left overs. The staff is polite and courteous. I love their beef Mongolian. I feel like they bread their chicken too much it is mushy. BUT great place, fast, good, and clean!","854":"Amazing pizza!!! Although they did forget my cheese sticks I forgive them, but don't let it happen again :)","855":"Came here with a group of 20+ to see Morgan Page on 11\/30\/12.\n\nArrival: Got to the club around 11pm. Getting to the club was simple, took only around 15 minutes from the car to the lines (and that included a bit of pre-gaming)! \n\nEntry: Got my entire group on a guestlist with a 1:1 (guy\/girl) comp until midnight. Sign up on their website and you will get a text back if you have been put on. The entry line was confusing as hell, with at least 4 different lines (staff, promoter, general, VIP). There was an open bar for ladies from 11-12 so things were a bit rushed. This came back to bite me in the ass as I made the mistake of leaving my guestlist line for the shorter staff entry line. Members of my group were with this female staff member who said could get us all free in even though our guy:girl ratio had more guys. I spoke with her personally to make sure of it before I left my line. Well...SHE LIED! The bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys:girls, leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry. My girlfriend was not pleased with the fact that one of my other group members (who came stag) got in for free and I didn't. Whatever, lesson learned. Don't rush in. Don't be tempted by an open bar or a shorter line. Stick with guestlist if you're approved. Make sure your group ratio is even or favors girls. Don't listen to otherwise!\n\nClub Layout: The club itself is very nice. Not quite as grand or spacious as XS next door, but a beautiful venue nonetheless. Main dance floor is average sized. It was spacious enough so that we didn't feel like canned sardines and had adequate room to dance. There are no stairs or steps to climb, a la Marquee, so ladies will appreciate this. The main room is flanked by a large tent-like area and the outdoor wading pool\/patio area. The easiest accessible restrooms are outside as well (the indoor one gets crowded). The outdoor area is ideal for those who want to socialize more, take pictures, take a breather, etc. It's beautiful.\n\nBar: The indoor bar layout is terrible. There was maybe 10 feet between the bar and the backs of the booths for those who got tables. This 10 feet also serves as the main walkway to get to the tent and outdoor area. Not so surprisingly, there is a lot of pushing, bouncers shining lights and telling you to move, and it worst of all: it takes forever to get a drink! I said before to not by tempted by an open bar for ladies and here's why: this is the only bar ladies can get free drinks from! On top of that, ladies can only get one drink at a time! So ladies, if you planned to be here for an hour and get drunk or pass drinks to the guys, you'll be disappointed.The outdoor bar nudged in between the tent\/outdoor area is empty and stress-free compared to the one inside, so I would recommend buying drinks from here. Drinks were typical Vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Surrender. The club was beautiful, my group had a blast, and Morgan Page (and his opener) rocked it! Learn from my mistake, stay away from the indoor bar, and come with great people and you will have one memorable night! 4\/5.","859":"Very fast to go service. The pad thai is made from bigger noodles than i'm used to but had a very good flavor","863":"Great quality of food!! The plates looked very clean and appetizing. The fish were fresh and was well proportioned with the rice - which I'm kind of particular about. Very nice service as well.\n\nParking is a bit tight and there is also limited seating especially during peak dinner hours.\n\nDefinitely would like to try take-out next time.","866":"Of course the food is good, employees are nice but I have never been to a slower Chick-fil-A in my life. I sat through the drive thru for 20 mins. Chick-fil-A is always super fast but these people seemed to have zero urgency. Extremely annoying.","867":"Wow!!! What a place. Took the kids here after Easter Brunch and had a great time. Can get a little pricey if not careful.  It took me an extra order of doughnut holes to convince them to leave!","868":"I want to start by saying that the staff there are all very friendly and knowledgeable, however I have not had a good experience there.\n\nI have a chronic eye condition that requires me to get a hard contact lens for one eye. Typically I had to go to Oakland to get all this done and I wanted to see if I could find somewhere closer to home. I got new glasses, lenses and a new hard lens here.\n\nFirst they lost the order for my eyeglasses. They never realized this until about a month after my visit and I called having not heard anything. When I got them the prescription was far too strong and they had to back it off. So getting my glasses took over two months.\n\nFor my hard lens it took time to get that correct as well, but that is expected. It also took me several times asking my Oakland optometrist to get my records faxed to them. McCauley-Celin at first said they never received them, but they then found them in another computer system. When the first lens didn't fit quite right I went to the Wexford office to get it checked and left my lens there as it needed to be returned. When my new lens came they asked for my old one and apparently it was lost out there or somewhere. I paid for my lens with my FSA account but then was told that it should be covered under my insurance and that they would take care of it. That didn't happen so I called to ask about it. They never got back to me so I went to their Gibsonia office and they said that they owed me money and it was fixed. This all again took several months.\n\n\nIf you just need glasses and lenses and are fairly routine in your needs, you'll probably be fine. But I'm going back to Oakland I guess. The office staff just can't handle anything.","870":"Travel weary and need of food - as I walked out my hotel heard some excellent acoustic music - enjoying some music ,  turns out it was $5 burger night - bonus -  California burger was juicy and the gauc and grilled onion perfect - i also tried the tortilla soup which i enjoyed. I also enjoyed the skinny crunchy fries and the chilled and crisp pickle The service was fast and friendly.  When i back to PHX and near the convention center I'll come again","871":"I'm a sucker for a good falafel,  and this place delivers. Ordered the combo with a side of hummus. Tasty,  fresh falafel and good but a little loose hummus. Would definitely come here again.","874":"Been here a few times, the service is super slow just to order a coffee. Coffee prices are not cheap. Ive had the sandwiches which are pretty good but heavy. Most people come here to use the free wifi and they sit for hours drinking water. Not my favourite place and the inside could be fixed up a little more.","877":"Good Korean grill near Eaton Centre. The marinate is good. We got beef, ox liver, salmon, fish fillet, chicken, pork, pork belly. The fish fillet was bland and liver was meh. Salmon and chicken was really flavourable. Such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends. Even alone. No judgments here. \nThe staff is attentive, nice and considerate. Bigger groups will most likely be seated on the second floor which is way bigger.\nCaution: will smell like BBQ grill after.","880":"Chilis is a bar and grill restaurant. It offers a dining area for you to sit in and at a table. It also gives you a bar so you can just sit at and enjoy drinks that have been made by the bartender. It offers a variety of food. From entrees like burgers, steak, and fish, and if you are not feeling to hungry then they have appetizers like hot wings, sliders, chips and salsa and so many more options. Also they allow you to order your food from home and pick it up and take it home. I personally like that there is so many options to choose from on the menu. I like how they also cater to the needs of someone trying to be healthy and watch their diet by adding healthy items to the menu. The staff is great and helpful. They don't hang around, and watch you eat. They check in at appropriate times to refill your drinks and ask how you're doing. The only thing I dislike is the waiting time. I usually have to wait 30 minutes to be seated. But that is because I usually go on the weekends, so it is understandable. I would give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars.","882":"Comfortable surroundings. Great service. Food was very good. Defiantly will be back to try the rest of the menu and for dinner as well.","886":"I liked it and it was 33 degrees outside. I usually don't eat ice cream with gloves on. Three scoops for a regular was more than enough for the two of us. valhrona chocolate was really good. pumpkin pie was so so.","892":"This is my go-to grocery store when I am too lazy to head to Winco. I have been here well over a hundred times, and the experience is pretty standard for Smith's stores in my experience.\n\nI have never had a problem with stocking here, which is good. Items are always stocked well, regardless of when in the week you come. I am not the biggest fan of their produce however. About 20% of the time, I bring how green beans or asparagus, and two days later they are covered in mold (and no, it is not my refrigerator). So I no longer purchase produce here except for when I am in a bind. Store is also always clean, I have never once seen a spill or poorly arranged merchandise, which is a testament to the hard working staff. \n\nThe staff are always very helpful and friendly. They don't always have enough baggers, but last time I was there they had plenty, and wouldn't even let me unload my cart (they had a separate person in the aisle that unloaded people's carts for them). First time I've experienced that and it was pretty great. \n\nPrices are a bit on the high side overall, I would not shop here if you do not use your Smith's card. The prices are outrageous with out it. However, they end up being pretty reasonable when you remember to use the gas points (which is now made easier by the Smith's gas station located directly in front of this store). \n\nThey DEFINITELY need way more cart corrals in the parking lot. Like at least double the amount they currently have. There are none closer to the gas station, and when the store is busy people are too lazy to walk their carts back to the corrals, and I've seen carts fly into parked cars on at least three separate occasions. I hope Smith's management reads this review and fixes this problem soon.","894":"Nestled in what is (for now) a relatively sleepy corner of Downtown, Urban Bodega (aka URBO) feels like something of a throwback to some of the small convenience stores I used to see line the Roosevelt Row neighborhood.  Back when Downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread, you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer, to snacks, to cooking essentials, and even a few household cleaning items.  The relatively new Pure Fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th Avenue in Downtown.  But for now, the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car.  All the more reason URBO's location makes sense.\n\nYou'll find URBO on the bottom floor of the Pure Fillmore Apartments on Fillmore Street just east of 7th Avenue.  The brainchild of DeSoto Central Market alum Shawn Connelly, you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way).  Inside, its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space.  Behind the counter, you can get coffee, tea, or even a sandwich made on the spot.  In front of the counter, it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect.  Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags.  I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here.\n\nFor my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up.  A tea and a sandwich.  I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin.  Both made to order.  Total cost including tax: $10.  Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here.  Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty.  I was also very happy with the tea.  Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents.  A solid breakfast.\n\nSo there you have it.  A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood.  Nothing pretentious.  Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store.  Even if you don't live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.  Or a sip and bite and it was in my case.","896":"Went to Alchemy today because my friend was craving a burger. I had never dined here before, but she had and suggested it. I was thoroughly impressed. She had the bison burger which was to die for, I had a bite and instantly wanted another. I ordered the BLFT and it was loaded with bacon and flavor. I had some minor issues with it, first being that there was just a little too much aioli on the bread and second that the fried tomato was a red tomato and not a green tomato. I just found the texture of the tomato unappetizing. I also enjoyed their bloody mary and they have a nice local, craft beer selection. For dessert we had the espresso torte and it was one of the best I have ever had. Service was also spot on and I will be returning soon to get the bison burger for myself!","897":"This was a great find near Pittsburgh alternative to down town scene. Ambiance was great on the deck by the river, and service was excellent (Thanks Melisa for history lessens!). Seafood including Oysters were fresh and well prepared. Price was reasonable for \"Prefix\" menu including scrumptious dessert.  What an evening to end a fantastic summer day in Pittsburgh.","898":"Looking for a big, hearty breakfast? Then look no further because this place has got exactly what you're looking for (and for a pretty reasonable price). I went here with my friend after a night of *ahem* good old Madison weekend fun, and this was exactly what we needed. I got the eggs mornay, which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an English muffin. And if that wasn't enough carbs for you, it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes. Good stuff.\n\nAlso a random note: despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner, I got a very hipster-y vibe from it once I got in.","901":"Nothing special here. It's about what you'd expect out of a Mongolian Barbecue style chain. Choose your base meat and carbohydrate (but not portions, that is set), add your choice of vegetables, then watch them roast it in front of you. I went with chicken and rice noodles, and a ginger garlic sauce. The finished product tasted like propane. The guys frying everything up work hard, but their efforts are about the best thing you can say about this place. I still like it better than Noodlecat, though, as it doesn't seem to take itself seriously. Many of the Kanji on the wall are backwards\/upside down.","906":"The staff is very nice and helpful but there pricing sucks!!!!! Very over priced. I went with my wife and my sister and brother in law, we all wanted to get tattoos. I have 6 so I am fairly familiar with tattoo pricing. Long story short why wife wanted a small piece that should be around $75 to Vegas price maybe $150. They wanted $350 bucks! They must be joking right my piece that should be maybe $150-200 they wanted $750. The point is that they apparently think that the ink is liquid gold or something.","908":"The atmosphere may be what you'd expect of a bar in the middle of a suburban development, but the food and drink are pretty good. \n\nOur friends love their beer, we gushed over their root beer. The malted berry drink was perfect for lightweights. \n\nThe Wisco Porker pizza was tasty and full of meat - just as you would want and expect. \n\nNice bonus - Free shots after touchdowns during Badger games. Woop!","909":"Atmosphere is nice, decor is cute and staff is really nice. The most important thing is that the food is BOMB. I got a buche taco, al pastor taco, and Mexican corn on the cob. The al pastor taco was the best out of all of them, with lots of juicy meat despite it looking weird and dry on the meat spinner (is that what it's called?). Buche taco didn't have as much meat which was kinda sad. The corn was delicious however the amount of parmesan cheese on top killed it a bit. The mole fries are AMAZING. Ten out of ten will come back for them.","912":"As an ex-NYer, I have a pretty high standard of bagel. These did not disappoint, but I wouldn't say they are truly singular in their yumminess. My review is based solely on these, as we did not try the desserts or anything else. Some of the bagels seemed \"fresher\" than others, and if you've ever had a NYC bagel before 8am, you know the expectations I have. I also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny, and the holes were big. I'm used to really fat, chewy but pillowy ones. Sigh.\n\nBut it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars, as they have a lot of traditional Jewish\/NYC deli delicacies, which you really don't see out here in LV. If that is your thing, you really should check it out! The rye bread with caraway seeds looked good. The dessert section also piqued my interest. Please don't get a black & white cookie - Hell will freeze over before anyone ever likes those, trust me.\n\nThe shop is located in the weirdest shopping complex - it feels like a dr's office belongs here. Inside, it was pretty poppin' (it was Sunday), but the line wasn't bad. \n\nAll in all, I will be back again to try more.","913":"I'm the first to give any Starbucks 5 stars because I am usually a fan. With that said, I am not a huge fan of this location.  First of all, I am not sure if this is country wide, but they charge 70c CAD to add a few drops of soymilk to some cold brew iced coffee, which is free in the US.  Additionally, their cold brew did not have the smooth flavor of the cold brew I am used to at Starbucks.  Third, mobile ordering doesn't appear to be functioning for this store or in Canada (this may be an app limitation and not specific to this location). On a good note, the bagel was edible and they had some type of guacamole avocado spread in a container which was better than I was expecting.  Update: I did write to corporate on the fact that I was charged money to put a few drops of soy milk in my cold brew and they did confirm that this is not a correct practice to charge for tiny amount of soy milk in iced coffee.","914":"If you're looking for a sweet and fabulous cocktail dress or lovely, special item for a date, Petal is a solid choice. \n\nWhen Petal first opened I was taken aback by the open, airy space but also by the prices. At first blush, this store didn't offer much under $150-$200 besides accessories. Yet, over time, Petal has begun to bring in a more varied selection that appeals to a wider, stylish market. While they still offer the $300-$450 cocktail dresses, they also showcase a variety of merchandise in the $75-$100 range. Plus, if you can catch them on a sale day, it's worth a trip.\n\nBrand wise, you'll find upscale brands like Shoshanna, Amanda Uprichard, Alice & Trixie, Frock by Tracy Reese, James Jeans, Anlo and Citizens for Humanity. As mentioned, they have begun to add more affordable pieces from Greylin and LA Clothing. You'll also spy a handful of accessories and handbags scattered about in a range of prices. \n\nOverall I like Petal and I know I'll saunter back in, even if just to take in the lovely dresses and stunning tops they have on display. Here's hoping they continue to add in more variety with price points!","918":"This review is only for take out matza ball soup. Real hot and tasty on rainy day. Some suggestions, though:  have sturdier containers for hot soup. Clear plastic are flimsy and can cause burns.  Need plastic soup spoons, teaspoons say we didn't plan for soup!  Also, I think cashier said bagel chips come with soup, but none were in bag.\nIndoor parking is the best on rainy days. \nA good work in progress.","919":"What's to say! It's a grocery store with what ya need downtown. It's not hipster or shady..it's just a good, simple grocery store with a great mix of produce, organic and other baked goods. The prices are fair even though some things I know are cheaper elsewhere; for many of us it means not having to drive so its all good.","921":"Seems old and tired!   I ate here frequently about 20 years ago and returned for happy hour this year.  This used to be a good place many years ago, but too many great restaurants have opened in recent years to eat here.  Strange rules about what you can eat in the bar area.  Food just meh.","928":"Not going into great detail. But I brought my car in for a problem I knew it had. They inspected the car and gave me an astronomically high quote on repair. The staff was very nice and place was clean and neat. I simply could not afford the price they gave. After continuing to research the repair needed and shopping around for quotes I know for a fact that these guys quoted double the going rate and what I ended up paying. \n\nAnywho, there are a ton of great shops out there. And I'm sure these guys are good too. But I can't justify paying double.","932":"I dined at P.J.'s last weekend.  I had heard many great things about their food and service, so I had to check it out.  I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well.  It was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the Forum Shops.  Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn't make a lot of eye contact.  His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.  I over heard other servers asking tables where they were from, and it was a little overboard.  EVERY person who came to a table asked that question.  The poor table next to us must've answered 15 times.  Here is a little tip: if the hostess asks, she should then communicate it to the server. So when the server approaches the table he\/she can say \"hey, I heard you are visiting from ____, welcome!\" Much more personal.\n\nAnyhow, on to the food!!\n\nWe started out sharing the french onion soup, a caesar salad and the tater tots.  All were delicious.  The croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful.  The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.\n\nMain Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1\/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.\n\nWe had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the \"canon\" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called \"bubble and squeak.\" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.\n\nFor dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.  It was warm and delicious, like an apple pie fresh out of the oven.\n\nOverall, I love the place.  They have a raw bar that often has happy hour specials for $1 oysters.  It is not too casual, but also not fussy.  Everyone is very friendly and welcoming and the food is great!","936":"Ugh here we go.. this is my second time ordering from crepe club through Postmates. Both times big let down. I order through Postmates several times a week and rarely ever have any issues so I know it's nothing they could of prevented unless the drivers start sampling the food and drinks before delivery. I ordered the regular chicken florentine - crepe was cold, doughy and undercooked. It was generously stuffed, almost too much. Spinach was fresh, but not cooked so it was like eating a salad in my crepe...the mushrooms, clearly were canned precooked mushrooms. I'm not totally offended by them, but when you put a ton in a raw crepe...not really tasty.\nIced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing.\nChocolate croissant- tasty, seemed fresh. Nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined. \nDear management, read your reviews. Common theme, crepes are undercooked. If you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food, you best knock it out of the park. IHOP makes a better chicken Florentine crepe. That's shameful. I gave it two shots both were overpriced let downs. Their space can't seem to keep a business longer than 2 years. I'll be shocked if they stick around.","941":"This place gets crowded. Waited 20 min for a table at 12:30pm during the lunch rush. it clears out after 1:30pm, no waiting after the lunch rush. The portions are HUGE here with the typical Deli style sandwiches and bagels.  The bakery has great items too.","943":"Love this bubble tea shop! Green grotto has a very nice and comfortable atmosphere and definitely a place where you can relax and have a drink. The drinks here are good and the food as well. They give out free popcorn which is very unique and cool. The service was great and the workers were also very kind. \n\nThis is a great place to go on a small cute date ~ \n\nI would definitely recommend to a friend!","944":"Had a nice date here with the bae on Friday night.\n\nWe ordered a couple of pints and enjoyed the vibe of this place overall.\n\nTo share, we decided on the fried jerk chicken wings, which were delicious. Bae ordered the baseball steak and I opted for a soup and salad.\n\nI tried a bite of the steak which was very tasty and the side of smashed\/fried red potatoes were oh so good. I enjoyed my french onion soup and arugula salad as well.\n\nI would return if I was in the area again :)","950":"Bricco is a local Junction restaurant that I truly would like to support. ..but it confuses me. There is a meticulous attention to detail about restaurant decor. However in a couple of visits with friends,  one of four in the group wasn't happy with what they selected...while the other three were thrilled. Is the Chef inconsistent or just trying too hard to be creative?\nI am always drawn to a menu with wine pairings. On new year last though, Bricco had a menu that didn't flow well and some of the wine pairings just didn't make sense to the point of requesting (and thankfully receiving) a replacement wine. I would have lost hope except the main was a cut of beef with an Italian pairing that was to die for!\nLets hope for more consistency and the locals will fill the room.","951":"Located next to the Costco near Woodbine & Hwy 7.  Looks like lots of people go for dim sum and grocery shopping without having to move the car.  However, unless you take advantage of their early bird pricing (we did not), not that great a place for dim sum...better quality\/price choices are readily available.  Our party of four paid $57 all in for 8 so-so dim sum dishes plus a noodle plate.","957":"Pretty bad. Was this place good at one time? For the price I paid, I expected something much better.\n\nTwo kids and an adult on a Friday nught. $86. Unbelievable. No selection of food. Quality of food sucks.\n\nOnly thing good was almond bread pudding.","960":"Even though a few flavours have been hit or miss for me here (maple was meh and there was a weird aftertaste to mint chocolate chip) I still look forward to trying flavours out from here because when the flavour is right on, it's amazing.","964":"It was great!\n\n\n\nThis place was really small, but I LOVED it, it was comfortable and a friendly environment. The kitchen is right there, its amazing, you can see what they are doing, the only thing that could be off putting is that this is Arizona and it is summer, so watching from the kitchen bar can get pretty warm, but then, just don't sit there.\n\n\n\nMy good friend loves the place and found it a few years before. So he recommended a few things, we had a bottle of Riesling with our baked Bree and blackberry (I think it was jam) it was amazing. Truly, and I am very particular about the types of cheese I'm okay with (food allergies)\n\n\n\nWe were just catching up, so we didn't decide immediately that we would stay for dinner, but, why not, I choose the pasta with lobster in an amazing carrot butter sauce and he had the standing Shepard's pie, you have to see it to believe how amazing it is. \n\n\n\nOur food was amazing, we had a second bottle of wine, which was also amazing and although my friend finished all of his food, I've never been able to finish a full plate of pasta in one sitting, so I brought some home. I actually ate the left overs, which is unlike me. \n\n\n\nThe owner talked to us for a bit, he was really helpful, talked to me a bit about my emerging interests in making wine\/beer and different outlets that would be helpful and reasonably priced. I didn't expect that, it was really nice of him to talk about their wide selection of wines, beers and other interesting concoctions. I wish that I had more time to try a couple of them.\n\n\n\nI will have to go back, sometime soon.","968":"Holy Crap, what's with the bad reviews? I can't believe that this is the same place we ate dinner at last night!\n\nWe came around 5 pm ans sat on the patio. We had several servers come and ask if we were ready to order, but we weren't. We wanted fried calamari and also some hot apps, but the Hot Platter for 2 only had the grilled calamari. Our server was nice enough to substitute the fried calamari for us at no extra charge. \n\nI had a glass of nice refreshing Greek white that hit the spot. The Greek Salad we had was super fresh and crunchy with a perfect dressing and just the right amount of feta.\n\nThe platter had 2 dolomades, that were very good and had a nice mint flavour behind the grape leaf. The house made sausage had loads of lemon zest in it and was exceptionally flavourful. Spanakopita was flaky, buttery and delicious and the octopus was nice, too. I have to say that the calamari was not as tender as I would have expected, but it wasn't terrible. They also brought us some delicious hummus that was made with fresh chickpeas. They also brought a nice helping of yummy tatziki on a plate.\n\nThe service was exceptional and we rarely waited for anything we needed. Our server asked my boyfriend if he wanted another diet coke, she cleared our cutlery from the greek salad and replaced it when our platter came. \n\nMaybe it was a fluke, but we had an absolutely great little nosh and I'd come back again anytime.","969":"Not the chipotle it used to be compared to couple years back..they are stingy with everything now..I barely come here anymore it used to be 2-3 times a week..step it up you are a big franchise now","980":"I've been there twice. The first time I got a load of pastries to go (which turned out to be yummy!) and the second time I went for breakfast. Both times, the service was great and the food was great. I don't know what it's called, but there's a filo dough \"tube\" filled w\/ spinach and cheeses... get it!  Their signage is practically non-existent, so they're unfortunately easy to miss. It's worth a visit.  :)","982":"A co-worker of mine kept talking about Tottie's, so last night I finally gave it a try.  I don't know if it is different dining in, because I ordered take-out, but it was good.  It didn't blow me away, but it was good.  Very similar to good chinese take-out, or maybe a notch up.  I ordered the Tottie Rolls as a starter.  They are crispy egg rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf, with mint and parsley.  They come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice.  Or atleast I think that is how you are supposed to eat them?  I had a big take out container full of lettuce, mint and parsley, so I figured that was the drill since I didn't order a salad?  They were good.  I ordered the Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na.  The chicken dish was good, tasted like an orange chicken, deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce.  It had a few strips of red bell pepper also.  The beef dish I liked a little more, it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef, onion, pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce.  You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT, so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish.  Next time I will definitely go hotter!  The dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice, which was exactly what it sounds like. I didn't have any dessert, but the crispy bananas sound great, and I am interested in trying the ice creams I keep hearing about.  I also really want to try the soups, they sound good.  \n\nAll in all, it was good (I keep saying good!)  the prices are reasonable, and the portions are big.  I have enough for lunch leftovers today.  So, it is worth giving them a try, and I will be back.","988":"Very slow and incompetent staff. Food is okay, nothing special. I would definitely avoid this place next time I'm in Vegas.","989":"Good food and nice clean place ... I ate the \"buffalo soldier\" there and took a \"sweet home alabama\" home ... yum","991":"I was really disappointed with my most recent visit to Vintage 95. I make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends. Tonight I went with my husband and in-laws. We ordered a carafe of sangria, which as always was top notch. My in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes. Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the \"artisan board\" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! The food was a huge rip-off, and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past. The saving grace of the night was the sangria, which I still think is one of the best in the area. But overall, I don't think this place is worth a trip out anymore.","993":"I feel like Friday's food menu has gotten worse over the years. The alcohol menu - big improvements, I mean, who wouldn't want a 'Diddy Up' - right?!\n\nThis particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way.\n\nThe seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here.\n\nSometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entr\u00c3\u00a9e, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals.\n\nI'll come back but only because it's cheap-ish & close to home.","995":"We ate there yesterday for the first time. My husband ordered fish tacos and I had the five shrimp with sticky rice. He loved his dish. The fish had a nice, slightly spicy sauce on them. It was Mahi Mahi. The shredded veggies were also just perfect. He said he would order it again. I also liked the dish I had. The asparagus was delightful. The rice section was very bland, but our waitress brought some soy sauce for me. This improved everything. I would just ask for soy sauce when ordering this dish again. I would order it again. We also shared a small dessert in a glass. It was boston cream pie. Very tasty. I was happy they had the nice, little desserts. Anything else would have been too much. It was perfect. We will definitely go back. The prices were very reasonable.","996":"I have never waited LESS THAN forty five minutes to see my doctor. While the staff are competent and I'm satisfied with the quality of care I've received, the constant over booking definitely soils my opinion.\n\nPeople go to spine specialists because THEY'RE  IN PAIN. Making patients wait for extended periods of time in terribly uncomfortable chairs is painfully ironic.\n\nPLEASE STOP OVER BOOKING. WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN GREED TO BILL MORE APPOINTMENTS PER DAY.","998":"Great ambiance, great food, although their policy of no reservations can be a drag.\nGreat place for ribs...they are so tender they fall off the bone. I always order the Louisiana chicken.....a flattened chicken breast smothered with grilled vegetables and goat cheese. Goat cheese is like bacon...it just makes everything better.\nAlso try their artichoke dip as an appetizer...it is the best out there.\nOn our last visit ( less than a week ago) ,their baked beans were different...hopefully it was just a hiccup because they are usually incredible.\nService is always excellent and the prices are reasonable considering portion size.","999":"Excellente place que vous passiez juste prendre un bon th\u00c3\u00a9 ou caf\u00c3\u00a9 ou que vous vouliez vous asseoir et manger un brownie d\u00c3\u00a9cadent ou un grill cheese aux oignons caram\u00c3\u00a9lis\u00c3\u00a9s. Le personnel est sympathique, pas stress\u00c3\u00a9 et ne met pas de pression pour consommer. Les enfants sont les tr\u00c3\u00a8s bienvenus et ont de quoi s occuper!!","1002":"I ordered the Heart Shaped pizza and meatball sliders on V-day and it really hit the spot. My honey and I both had to work but wanted something easy that maintains the V-day spirit. Why not a heart shaped pizza? They had a special of a large heart shape with an extra topping for about $20 with tax. Pretty good deal!\nIf you don't already know, Metro pizza serves up a pretty yum pie. I am familiar with a few of their locations, and this one did not taint the reputation. \nMy favorite thing from Metro however, is not the pizza. It is their meatball sliders with fries. BOMB! Yummy meatball sheltered in a garlic knot, YAS PLEASE! They are soooo good! The fries is really good too. Only complaint, fries portion shrinks every time we order the sliders. Please don't skimp on the fries!\nMy experience with Metro is solely based on take out. I need to plan a time to dine-in.","1003":"I knew coming here, there would be a long line. We waited about 25 mins which isn't too bad. There is a menu displayed around the corner so it is nice to look at what you want to order before you get to the cashier.\n\nWe got the infamous \"slut,\" Fairfax sandwich and some orange juice. The orange juice taste so good! So refreshing and taste fresh squeeze! The Slut is pretty good, its eggs and mash potatoes with bread to dip. The sandwiches are amazing and the Fairfax doesn't disappoint. I still think of the bread and how soft it is! \n\nJust give it a try, you won't be disappointed.","1007":"Been a while since we came here but loved it.  Little bit loud but ok and maybe not as fancy as some of its other locations (Chicago, Miami), but:\n\n- food was same and awesome.  \n- loved the Wygu Beef Gyoza, couple rolls we had, salad, drinks, etc.\n\nGreat menu right now they have to choose from.  Seems the same in all cities for the moment.","1008":"Food was good but  took forever. It seemed like they needed more help. 20 minutes for not being that busy.  Hopefully next visit is better.","1010":"Read the reviews and thought I would try it. Yelpers were on point with this one. Good Asian fare, reasonably priced and nice portions. Food was very fresh tasting and seasoning not overpowering. I will definitely come back. Service was great also. This is a hidden gem in the Hard Rock!","1013":"We have been trying Eggplant sandwiches all over the valley because my day loves eggplant.  Delfaco's sandwich on the Italian Hoagie had way way too much bread more bread than eggplant.  The eggplant by itself was very tasty, but get it without so much bread, you will thank me later.  We will be back to try something else.  I went at 11 am on a Saturday morning and still waited over 30 minutes for a take out order.  It is a very crammed space, a little Italian deli in between a Italian grocery store.  The prices for the Italian pastas and cheese are a bit over priced.  The espresso is nicely priced at $1.40 for a single shot.","1015":"All you need to know is DRIED AND BLAND. My burrito tasted like cardboard. If you've placed cardboard in your mouth, you know what I mean. Texture was similar too. \n\nOh and they forgot my order. I stood there for 10 mins then someone realized I didn't have my order.","1017":"Yum! Wasn't expecting this to be as good or as nice atmosphere wise. With a name like nando's was comparing it to filly bees, much better! Homemade chips and salsa. As a vegetarian I seriously appreciate the ability to order tacos, burrito, or chimichangas with veggies or potatoes! Plus you can't beat pitchers of Dos Equis! I took off a star because their guacamole tastes like it comes from a package. This place gets enough business to use real guacamole. Worth a taste if you're in the area!","1026":"Looking at the bad reviews, I was kind of scared before getting the vehicle. I thought I will keep it on hold to experience it and if something goes bad I would try at other rentals.\n\nBut the whole process was so smooth. I booked it through Costco Car Rentals so the rental was bit less and I got a decent rate for insurance.\nReached at terminal-2 parked my personal vehicle and took the shuttle to the Car rentals place.Reached Budget at 9:30AM to pick up the vehicle, there was one guy in the queue.\nThe rental guy was very friendly and he offered me 3 flavors of the Jeep and he gave me the 2015 model. The vehicle was in excellent condition and make sure you don't mess up with the vehicle while returning.\n\n4 Star because of few issues:\n- they never picked up the call before I could get my Jeep.\n- Before I got the Jeep, someone had put chocolates inside the cabinet and the Jeep manual was in lot of chocolate !!!! I wanted to know more about the 4W drive but looks like no one knew how to operate it. I googled it  out and found my answers. Yes one lady came and cleaned the chocolates before I got my Jeep.\n\nYes I am  impressed about the whole process of Budget Sky Harbor.","1032":"We had been searching for a new place to get our Maltese and Yorkie groomed since we weren't satisfied with our current groomer. I was a little nervous dropping them off but the ladies there are so nice and reassuring!\n\nWe couldn't pick them up until the end of the day and they made sure that my dogs had time to play and run and werent in a cage all day. Their haircuts are exactly what we wanted them to be and they looked so cute! They smelled clean and looked so happy. Will definitely be coming back!","1041":"I've had the pleasure of dining at the other locations of Yardbird so I was pretty excited to be able to try out their new Vegas location. \n\nI like it, although it definitely departs from the Southern draw of the other location and that authentic kitchen to table feel. We got the usual deviled eggs, chicken and waffles, and cobbler to finish. Overall the chicken was not as great as the Miami location and the cobbler was a bit disappointing. However, the eggs were delicious and waffles were on point!\n\nI will say it's a pretty solid lunch spot so definitely pay a visit when you have a chance.","1047":"I have stayed in so many hotels in vegas and by far for the money you will not find a better hotel room for $220 on a Saturday night. This room was a one bedroom with two flat screens, a 19inch tv in the restroom, a mini bar a restroom big enough for 20 people, shower and deep tub and  even a second restroom. You could have your own party here and could sleep 4-5 if you had to. Its always a speedy check in and out even when there is a line with 15-20 people. This is the only room I have stayed in for under $250 per night and I actually felt like I was in a fancy upscale suite. These are really cool rooms.","1050":"I was staying across the street at the Wynn and my post-Disneyland Half Marathon legs weren't really up for a lot of walking, so I suggested we check out TI for dinner. I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, \"The Buffet\" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.\n\nFirst, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nI hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino! They pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air. Yuck","1053":"A solid 3.5, based on the Chicken Sandwich\n\nI cannot speak about the pizza or pasta, but this sandwich shop is in a really convenient location for me.  I stopped in 'cause I was pressed for time, had to grab a quick dinner, & didn't want Subway\/McD's in the plaza.\n\nI asked the girl taking the orders about which was better, either the Panzarotti OR 1 of the sanwiches.  She answered sandwiches and suggested the Chicken.  Chicken was in a schnitzel format, flattened, breaded, & deep fried - actually quite similar to a veal sandwich!\n\nOnly 1 size of sandwich here and they were quite substantial, cut in half in which I only ate half for dinner, all for $7.  Cheaper than On-A-Bun.  A slew of toppings (cheese, mushrooms, peppers, etc.) were ALL included for an additional $1.  Not bad if you feel as though you need these additional things.\n\nHot green peppers were added as I wanted it spicy.  Very good, especially when it's eaten fresh!\n\nNo nonsense sandwich place, hopefully healthier than McD's??  ;)","1055":"Pretty stinky service today. Although the food is usually good bar food, we didn't get to place our order today.  No less than 5 servers passed our table while we waited to place our order. Maybe we just caught them in the middle of a shift change. Ended up leaving, but not too upset as we went to Taste of Buffalo where their wing are just better.","1056":"This was soooo good ! The fish was delicious. Make sure you give them your total rewards card for more points. Everything taste really good. If you're Platinum and up you're drinks are included (alcoholic) but you might as well grab drinks off the casino floor \nThe ice cream is made in house it's NOT soft serve. There are comfortable booths and tv screens in there. The bathrooms are located OUTSIDE. Ask for directions. It was good. For the 3 of us it was $81 just to give you an idea \nI was too busy stuffing my face to take photos. Sorry !","1057":"Honestly I just don't get the how everyone is so in love with this place?  I'm not a native so when I moved to the area many years ago everyone advised my family that we absolutely had to try a burnt almond torte from Prantl's.  We did, and to be fair that is a great dessert.  However, I have worked across the street from them for a decade now, and the office ladies I work with have brought in nearly everything they sell at Prantl's over the last decade.  The cookies, the cupcakes, the junior pastries, danishes, donuts, etc... have all made there way into our office, and I have never been wowed by any of them.  In fact I find most items to be pretty sub par.  I think if Prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars, but that's not the case, and since I have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery, not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition, I find them to be quite lackluster overall.  If you want a true bakery treat I would suggest  La Gourmandine for anything, Vanilla for cupcakes, Jean Marc Chatellier, even the somewhat overrated Oakmont Bakery, as other than the burnt almond torte, you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting Giant Eagle quality, which is fine, but at that point you might as well go to Giant Eagle and pay accordingly.","1058":"I had lunch at the buffet and it was by far the best buffet I've had in Vegas to date (I've travelled here quite often). The choices at lunch time are a bit overwhelming as they had full breakfast choices with omlette station, sushi bar, meat carving station, pastas, deserts, and the list goes on and on. My only dissappointment was that I could not eat more.  Best $20 buffet\/variety you can have on the Strip.","1060":"We were looking for Lancasters and ended up here.. which was good bc the food was pretty good! \n\nI had the philly with onion and mushroom and white american cheese and the homemade chips and it was all delicious. The sandwich had a lot of flavor without being really greasy (as cheesesteaks often are) and the chips were a good mix of crispy and soft that I expect when I'm getting homemade chips. \n\nOther dishes at the table - chicken club sandwich (reportedly VERY good) and a cheeseburger (reported as Ok, but he ate it all so it couldnt have been too bad!!)\n\nNote: They had the BEST Sweet tea I've had in a few years. Really super delish.\nI'd definetely go back here.","1063":"This shop combines coffee, breakfast and coffee break items and a yarn shop (which made my wife happy). During a recent visit we enjoyed well made asparagus and ham quiches with well dressed side greens. There were three regular and one decaf offerings from two area roasters. Service was friendly and helpful.","1067":"Ended up there for beer week. Atmosphere is great although pretty loud. Had the calamari, octopus, and wings appetizers. First two were really good bites though small portions. Wings were spicy but not special. Looking forward to them opening up the butcher shop.","1068":"Boarder grill has pretty good food, but I've had just ok meals there too. Considering the prices I'd expect every meal to be exceptional but I haven't been blown away every time. It's a special place for the wife and I so we do enjoy going. The drinks are pretty amazing and I leave stuffed every time. I suggest anything with steak in it and you can't go wrong. Not a fan of red meat? Go for the carnitas.","1069":"I was still too full from lunch at The Coffee Cup in Boulder City to eat a whole dinner. I had the white sangria, excellent. Also the salad with the Asian pear and blue cheese crumbles. The dressing was mango, and delicious. But the best part were the desserts. We had the pineapple upside down cake w. coconut ice cream, and the chocolate molten cake, with raspberry coulis and vanilla ice cream. WOW! Both were just awesome. We don't have anything comparable to the pineapple upside down cake in Boston, it was fantastic. Service was excellent!","1076":"Got here around 1:45, waited in line for about 15, not bad.  Bad happens now.  The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.\n\nI get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)\n\nSo here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:\n\nThere is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???\n\nThe lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.\n\nIf you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.\n\nLock box is available for $20 by the entrance.\n\nNot going back.","1078":"I have only been here a few times now but it is the closest bowling alley to my home and I have kids so there you go.  I never had a problem here and my kids like bowling and the game zone which all cost me a pretty penny but this is a business.  Soda here is almost as much as the movie theater and the food isn't all that good but that is not why you come here.  I will go back when the kids ask and I am grateful to have a nice clean location for bowling near my home.","1082":"Average food and service. Kind of dirty and some flies going around. Was ignored by two staff members when I walked up to ask a question. Plastic cups, bowls, and chopsticks.","1084":"We were there in the morning on a Saturday, the line for the place stretched around it and back to the elevators. Clearly 45 minutes. This is sort of a fast food situation, not a sit down restaurant, and by that I mean you buy the food and fight for a place to eat at a very few seating options. I'm sure the food is good based on these reviews, but don't make a special trip to go here if you are in the area, like we did. We ended up going somewhere else. No eggsluttiness for us, unfortunately.","1085":"I have gone to this place for years, and will go back but never to Jen....\nLets just say I had an eyebrow disaster. I will never tint again here. I asked for a light brown and I looked like Bert and Ernie. Awful and right before engagement photos....","1086":"We went because of the high recommendations. I wish we would have walked out as soon as we saw the tacky decor. Each meal is large enough to feed an entire family if that family wants a low quality meal. They definitively stress quantity over quality.  I suggest passing on this one.","1092":"I get mani\/pedis, waxing and lashes. \nThe technicians are professional and friendly. \nThe salon is clean and trendy. \nIf it wasn't for the receptionists at the front desk \n(or should back desk), I may have given a 5 star review. I have to say that I've never encountered such a rude, unfriendly, caustic group of women. \nI've been told that this is a common complaint and that the owner knows, but doesn't care.","1095":"This restaurant was really good & we all had a wonderful dining experience with our large group. Excellent & attentive service, fresh & flavorful ingredients, nice plating of entrees, and walked out of there full & happy. Would definitely go back again.","1097":"My kids took me here for my birthday dinner. \n\nI had the gigantic pork chop and generous helpings of mashed potatoes and rice. Yes, I know that's a LOT of starch but one of them was a substitute for -- I think -- Brussel sprouts, which I do NOT eat.\n\nBut it was DELICIOUS.\n\nI had been craving a pork chop for months. \n\nThanks Harevey's for a great night.","1102":"the ice cream is great but the owner is very rude. everytime i go in there she always have something rude to say. the ice cream gets 5 stars and the owner gets no stars!","1108":"Very good but a little pricey though. The fire in the bar area is very cool though. The food is good. Very nice place","1109":"First time in this place. Pretty impressive. I liked the lemon popcorn chicken with green onions..good flavor and sauce. The soy garlic chicken wings were a little too sweet actually, I wish they were a little less sweet and more garlicy. Bimbap was excellent. Delicious and very comforting. Of course all the sides great as usual with Korean Cuisine. Overall, we were pretty happy. Service was good, even though I've never been a fan of pressing a button to get the server's attention. I am not sure where that started but it's a bit  awkward and not very classy. Would come back and have a few other things on the menu.","1111":"Other than being served pretty cold (through the drive thru), the food wasn't that bad.  Would have been way better warm though.","1113":"I don't think I've ever had this type of cuisine before, what a treat. Got there around 8 and it was packed with indians and hipsters ;)\nThe vegetarian dosa is quite good, we also the lamb biryani. Had to wait a little for a table but service was fast and friendly.","1119":"This place is located at the heart of Eastern so it's always packed. Food is mediocre. Ordering is very confusing and there was no staff to ask or usher the guests in. With the music too loud, you actually have to shout to the food preparers what you want to order. Pricing was not too bad, though.","1122":"Good selection of specialty pizzas. $18 range on large but very tasty for hand tossed pizza.","1146":"EDIT:\nPaul reached out to, and all issues were addressed !! Thanks, Paul !\n\nThis review is for the Henderson location. I could have sworn I submitted a review when it happened, but it somehow disappeared. Weird. Anyways, I heard the Vegas location is much better. \/shrug\n\nI had two cars repaired here at the same time (vandalism damage). While the actual body work and paint was fine, everything else was a total disaster. One one of the cars, a quarter sized dent in the rear quarter panel seemed to have been caused in the shop. We didn't notice it when we picked up the car at night, so we got screwed right there.\n\nThe other car was supposed to be in for a week, and it ended up taking three. They ripped off the front splitter and half-assedly screwed it back on without telling me about it, and I only realized when one of the employees accidentally spilled the beans. After we had to go back to have the replaced window tinted (which took them 3 days !), a big scratch was on the trunk lid. Some sort of white residue was all over the car, and the seal around the window was sticking up in all sorts of places. I should have sued them, but I was tired of the aggravation.\n\nNow somebody rear ended me, and guess what, the insurance company wants to send me there. There's not a snowball's chance in hell I ever have them touch any of my cars again.","1151":"Played an 18-hole round on a Saturday during the mid morning several weeks ago.   The starter got us off on time, so that is always a good thing.\n\nThe course as mentioned is previously is 27 holes (three 9 hole courses) along with an Executive course.  We played Red to Blue that day.  The course is fairly wide open but there are some tight holes where a well placed drive will be key.  There are some holes with a few blind shots, but this is not the norm.  There are some water holes and some well placed bunkers.  \n\nOverall the course was in really good shape.  Tee boxes and greens were well kept.  There are some burnt out patches on the fairways, but nothing significant.  \n\nMy only 'gripe' would be a pace of play.  The course is very crowded and yes, I went at the a time where it is even more crowded.  We played in just over 5 hours, which is too long, but there was really no place to go.  There is no beverage cart service either, so it is wise to load up prior to going out or at the turn.\n\nPrice was a little expensive, coming in at $55 for 18 and a cart (weekend rates).  Overall, I like coming here, the course is usually in great condition and the employees are always polite and professional.","1157":"An interesting restaurant with a variety of items on the menu. Came here with my dragon boat team for dinner. Quite the busy and huge restaurant located in the Old Montreal. Seems to be quite popular considering the long line outside. Luckily\u00c2\u00a0we had a reservation for 52 guests so we had a private room. So for that many people, 2 staff assigned to our group wasn't enough.\n\nFor food, I ordered the salmon pizza with arugula. Nice size and quite delicious with a good amount of salmon slices on the pizza. The pizza crust was nicely prepared. For $22, its a little bit on the pricier side but was glad I ordered this tasty dish. For drinks, I ordered a Pina Colada and a beer that's local to Quebec. \n\nOverall, a pretty positive dining experience. Thoroughly enjoyed my food. Staff were friendly and on point with making sure everything was pleasant.t They have quite the extensive menu here which makes it difficult to chose just 1 item here. Highly recommend this place if you happen to be around the old Montreal square.","1163":"ordered a combo burrito, very little chicken, a lot of beans, also come with 8 pieces of chip, for 8 dollar, not worth it at all, i rather go Roberto on Fort apache, much better at anything","1164":"I've been to the Ajax location and didn't have the best experience. I would still give the Ajax location another try because maybe I just had them on an off day. The butter chicken was not creamy and did not have enough sauce in it at all, chicken was dry.\n\nTHIS location on the other hand, the interior was clean, staff were very friendly (not that they werent at the other location) The butter chicken was so delicious! The white meat was well cooked, moist on the inside, the portion of sauce to meat was perfect and the sauce was seasoned with all of the right ingredients making it so creamy.\n\nI also really enjoyed the chicken poutine. It had lots of flavour and im a fan of their fries, crispy and yummy.\n\nI would go back to this location! :)","1171":"I love chefs Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, so I was looking forward to experiencing the restaurant during my stay.  The first night we ate at the bar and had a blood orange margarita with a mole rim and the citrus chicken quesadillas.  It was so good I did not want to stop eating, but I was stuffed.  On my last day, we had lunch there, also at the bar.  It was happy hour so the drinks were a little less expensive.  I had the spicy shrimp tacos.\n\nFood, drink and service are phenomenal.  Prices are average; not overly pricy, but not cheap.  You are paying for quality in food and service, so just do it.  Go there.  Eat there.","1178":"This is such a fun addition to University circle.  I've been here twice; both times to watch football games.  There are at least twenty widescreen tvs here.  Its two stories with bars and bowling lanes on each floor.  They take reservations and have valet  parking.  Both times I got the chicken tenders.  I wouldn't come here specifically for the food but rather for the \"activity dining\" atmosphere.  Bowling for walk ins is 35$ per hr but 50$ per hr for reservations.  The shoe rental is 3$.  The entrees are 10 to 20$ and mixed drinks around 8 to 10$.  This is my go to place to watch big games.  Bowling here with a group friends will always make for an enjoyable event.","1180":"Not a 5 Star hotel, but still worth checking out. You can't beat the location either....","1182":"Love this place. Good vibe. Friendly staff. Great music. $5.50 pints. \nWill definitely come back!","1183":"So far so good...19.99 gets  you and a guest in. The staff is nice and friendly. This place is way cleaner then the other gyms in the area. Only downside is that this place gets hot . seems to be a crap ac or something..\nBut overall the experience is pretty okay...\n\nTip place gets super packed from 5~9","1184":"The crepe is a must try at this store. The drink is quite sweet, including both cold and hot drinks. The desserts in the cooler are terrible, looks nice for Instagram pic though.","1189":"My husband and I stopped in to Guitar Center on a Saturday afternoon in search of a keyboard. I'm a vocalist, but I needed something simple and affordable to help me in my practicing. \n\nWhen we arrived I saw it was quite busy inside. Employees were very busy running around everywhere to help different customers. I was actually a little happy about this because I didn't want to be pressured by someone into buying a fancier keyboard than I needed. We were able to browse the selection, try different options, and decide on our own. After making our choice I tracked down an employee at the front desk (Tyler) who came and helped us right away. He asked if we need a power source, and I'm thankful he did, because that's something I didn't think about. He tracked down what we needed and checked us out. He asked if we wanted a warranty, and he was able to answer all my questions about it without pressuring me. \n\nTyler was super helpful, professional, and efficient, and I'm thankful he was the one to help us. We were very satisfied with our experience and will definitely be back to this location for our future music needs!","1190":"I've shopped at a half-dozen or so Neighborhood Markets. This is Walmart's Supermarket concept. That means that it's about groceries and dairy and frozen and meats, plus a section for personal care. The store doesn't have a Tire & Lube or a Vision and not much for electronics and zero for housewares and clothing. Just food.\n\nAnd as Neighborhood Markets go, this one was pretty good. The shelves were stocked, the store was tidy on a Sunday morning and the associates who I encountered knew the \"Ten Foot Rule.\"\n\nIt was a good shop.","1202":"This place is always chaotic.  Super super super busy, but that's because it's really fun!  As a girl, I know a lot of girls wouldn't be comfortable or have fun golfing at a \"driving range,\" but that's why Top Golf is so great, because even if you don't want to play, you can just hangout and eat\/drink with your friends who are playing.  Whether you're coming here for a date, birthday party, in a big group, or whatever it may be, this place is great for people of all ages.  The atmosphere itself is really fun and it's just a super cool idea that's entertaining.","1203":"I have been eating warm pies on location and buying frozen pies to eat at home ever since the first location opened. \n\nI am a huge fan of their savoury pies! I honestly cannot pick a favourite because I like so many of their pies and decide on the flavour based on what I'm craving at the time. I enjoy the braised beef rib, beef 'n beer, butter chicken (slightly spicy), veg-ilicious, pulled pork. The seasonal flavours are great too!\n\nI'd love to try the lobster shrimp, but it's been sold out whenever I visit.\n\nAs for the sweet pies, the cheesecake with raspberry is my fave! \n\nI also enjoy the coleslaw. The dressing is tart and the perfect amount. The dried apricot adds a great texture and sweetness. I just wish the cabbage was chopped more finely. The carrots are julienned, yet the cabbage is chopped in large pieces, which makes for a tough texture.","1206":"Great fresh burgers. I had cheese burger with fried egg side of chili onion rings. Price kind of high. Original LA is much better.","1208":"Well, it was not amazing. There are better places in Charlotte to get sushi. And we were over charged for our drinks! Aside that, the service was great and the place is nice. Would I go back? Likely no.","1210":"This place is an excellent place to go if you are in or around the Strip.  The food is delicious, prices are good, and staff is friendly.  Although i have only had the chicken, you cannot go wrong with it.  I have had the 1\/2 chicken and also the crispy chicken burrito and both were very good.  In addition, I always get the yucca fries; my lunch order is now a burrito with yucca fries and all for under $10 and i can't finish it all.  In addition, always get the green sauce and use it to your heat tolerance.  It definitely has a kick to it, so mix it with some mayo especially for the yucca fries.  I don't know if I would drive out of my way to eat here, but it is worth going if you are close.","1214":"I have been going to Dental Care West, the west side clinic offered by A.T. Still University since April 2015. They came highly recommended.  \n\nI have had my scheduled appointments change 3 times without my approval. I find out about the change when I show up for my originally schedule appointment. This is very bad customer service.\n\nOtherwise, most of the residents are OK dentists. You have to have a new dentist every July, so I am up to my third 'regular\" dentist. To get my appointments when I needed them, I changed the resident & dentist. I found out that many of the residents and their coaching dentists don't read the files to know what is going on with my treatment before I come in. This bad practice. I also had a problem when the dentist did work he thought I needed without discussing it with me first but not owning up to it after I got angry. Frustrating.\n\nI have to go back hopefully only 1 more time to fix the problem they created. Problem: I had root canals and crowns done and then they did the implant extraction. During the healing time, my prior crowned teeth shifted resulting in a large gap between my teeth and pain.  They do realize that this is a problem they caused and are not charging me but they keep putting off doing the work. So now I'm re-scheduled with a different resident\/dentist so I can get my work done.\n\nThe support staff that help the dentists are the best. Front office -not so much. It's been a long drawn out process.  I just want my teeth fixed. It shouldn't be this difficult.","1222":"Food is good but they dont let you mix match like bdubs ... So for that u get two stars bruh","1224":"Let me start with positives. I've never had a bad (weak) drink at Kelly's, and I feel it's very reasonably priced. The only food I've tried was the mac and cheese, which was ok given how much it cost.\n\nKelly's has two major issues: cleanliness and service. The booths are covered in crumbs, regardless of the time of night, and the tables often need wiping. Mysterious sticky stains abound.\n\nThe service would be so-so if not for this crazy policy: let's say you sit at a table. No waiter has been paying attention to you, so you go to the bar to get a drink. Are you allowed to bring that drink back to your table? No, you have to drink it at the bar! It's a kind of catch-22.\n\nFor these reasons, I have to give a 2 star rating - there are better bars around.","1226":"Holy smokes! This place is one time consuming portal of gimmicks and awful service. First, the service is not great and the overall experience is way too pricy. Now, never mind that the overpriced single dish indian entrees are mediocre at best ... for some reason a sword wielding candle balancing bellydancer is supposed to make for a good experience? \n\nIt was loud as hell inside, and then the bellydancing made any conversation entirely inaudible to the point where i had to ask my 'server' what he said numerous times. Now aside from letting children play with a massive sword by other guests, balancing candles on her head, and harassing patrons to get up and dance with her, the bellydancing was not only dangerous but unnecessarily noisy.\n\nThe food itself? Meh. Ive been to many indian places, this is the least impressive. But hey, we got to wait an extra hour before paying a $60 bill for 2 people.","1234":"I wanted to like this salon- it seemed cute and trendy.. I had just had a baby and was really looking forward to a fresh new haircut.  Unfortunately my experience was disappointing.  The front desk attendant offered the person who came in about 10 minutes after me a cup of tea, but failed to offer me any tea until that point when he realized he had forgotten to ask me if I wanted tea as well.  As soon as he brought the tea to me my stylist was ready so I didn't get an opportunity to drink it.  I showed my stylist pictures of what I wanted and explained in detail what I did and did not want.  She said she could do it and proceeded to cut my hair without conversing with me at all the whole time.  As a disclaimer I have curly\/wavy hair.  I asked for side swept bangs that blended into my layers. The stylist insisted on blowing my hair out straight when she was finished-including a full fringe of blunt cut bangs on my forehead.  When I got home and examined my hair I saw all the layers were uneven and there was no way to style the bangs except to pull them back with bobby pins.  \n\nI now go to another salon and the person who cuts my hair does so for less than this salon charged- and it looks great every time...\n\nI was really disappointed because its seems like other people had good experiences at this salon.","1238":"Fried Rice - Tasteless, Tasteless\nChicken Wings - Dry, Dry\nPot Stickers - Doughy, Doughy\nYummy, Yummy - Isn't, Isn't","1239":"Horribly over priced! The selection was such a shame, very few dessert to choose from. Service was slow and not very friendly, It was are first time at the MGM how were we supposed to know !\n\nwill not be returning","1241":"After having issues with nearby Terrible Herbst. Trying to use Gift Cards, I received . Went to this one. Was in and out with no issues. Thanks Sarra. Worth leaving one of the Gift Cards at other store.","1250":"This is not the fastest branch, but it is the branch that several employees know me from me coming in often. They are personable here and really take time to make sure you are taken care of.","1252":"Fast and efficient downtown Calgary Starbucks.  Was impressed with the baristas ability to keep up with large orders, all correct and quick.  Great Job!","1254":"I got a prenatal massage during my stay at Omni and it was so nice and lovely. I felt very relaxed and it was much needed. Was able to enjoy a few more hours after the massage lounging in the spa pool and enjoyed a lovely lunch with my husband overlooking the mountains.","1266":"With fresh beer and seafood and service is really good here as they have an upstairs and a downstairs. I find that this location is usually packed; why not be they're so good. Food portions here go by the pound. This restaurant is a really good location for someone who truly loves to eat seafood. I will definitely be going back in the near future.","1270":"I came here for a party a few weeks ago so I can't rate this place as a restaurant. \n\nIt's a very upscale joint. Bartenders did a good job of quick service. Typically expensif drinks bottle service once specials were over; just about what one would expect.\n\nThe decor is modern. Large screens placed through the upstairs lounge. The DJ played some really great hip hop sets; really loved the music. I especially liked the upstairs outdoor patio area. Very cool place to hold a party!","1271":"Tucked inside the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express next to the PNC Building, Sammy's is a little diner that serves up breakfast and lunch staples for prices that don't break the bank. One of the few downtown breakfast places open on Saturday, I was glad Sammy's was as good as it is convenient. Bacon here is crisp, potatoes are better than Huran St diner and my heart is still true to the people at PJs but this is definitely where you'll find me the next Saturday morning I get a taste for eating breakfast out in the East 4th neighborhood.","1272":"Went with a party of six the other night and wasn't sure what to expect based on the mixed reviews.  They do not serve individual meals but rather small to medium plates meant for sharing.  I was very nervous about how this would work as we have very adventurous eaters in our group down to a pregnant picky eater.  Our water recommended 2 selections per person.  This ended up being a bit to much food.  The ratio of 1.5 per person would be better.  The food comes out as its ready,not all at once.  Be prepared in advance to share food. We ordered: oysters on the half shell with the siracha lime dressing ( some of our parties first experience-success), a meat and cheese board (jellies were weird-wouldn't order again), chicken wings, roasted chicken, lobster roll, sliders, macaroni and cheese, green beans, steak tartare ( skip), a breakfast dish, mussels and calamari. For the most part our entire table enjoyed all of the food and was very happy.  The rings were perhaps the biggest hit ( they are a little spicy and smokey)  resulting in one member of our party declaring we must perfect our smoking technique in order to do wings like that at home.  The green beans were also a big hit, which is shocking because we were not that excited about ordering beans. Overall we had a great time but it was in part because we were willing to share, work together on a menu selection and have fun. Go with an open mind, good group and you will not be disappointed.  There was some confusion with the beer flights ordered but our waiter (who was excellent) quickly corrected.","1277":"I came here because of the mac n cheese. And yes, it's definitely that good. But I've kept coming back because of the drink specials, old school cocktails, the awesome patio, and happy hour food deals.\n\nThe happy hour snacks are priced too good to pass up, but honestly, aren't really that special. I think I've ordered the tofu tacos 20 times and I never even really liked them that much, they're just too cheap to pass up. The tofu bites are okay, too, with spicy wing sauces but nothing too special there. The mac n cheese is amazing, like everyone has said, but it is a recipe for a heart attack and doesn't pair well with a night out drinking.\n\nThe cocktails, on the other hand, are crazy good. They have a classic menu with old-school drinks that I've never heard of before. A lot of them are knock-your-socks-off strong and unique, and one drink each day is on special, depending on the day of the week.\n\nSo I guess what I'm really saying here is, go to Kelly's for a fun atmosphere and grab a couple crazy drinks on the patio with some mac n cheese and sweet potato fries and you won't be broke or disappointed.","1282":"This gas station is really close so i go to it alot. Most of the workers are great friendly people then there is some there that could us a customer service training and learn to be nicer to people but other thrn that great gas station","1287":"Took my Mom here for a game night, and we had a blast! \n\nAll games are free and pinball is 50 cents. I consider this to be very reasonable. They have change machines for cash, but we didn't have cash. No ATM...yet. We had to go get cash to play. I don't think this will be an issue anymore once the ATM is available. We went early on a Thursday night and we practically had the place to ourselves. Not the biggest game selection I've seen, but still great. Also have foosball. \n\nBeer selection is decent, even though a few taps were out when we were there. A lot of local offerings. I LOVE the bar is made out of old cassette tapes! We tried the nacho pretzel, and it was a bit of a let down. Needed more salt, more flavor. I'm sure this will all get better as things go.\n\nOverall, I am so pumped to have this place in South End! It is a great break from the usual and a great place to hang out any day of the week. We will be back! The only thing that made me do 4 instead of 5 stars was the food.","1289":"What can you say about a thrift store? How about it's thrifty, sometimes. Because we live 5 minutes away my wife goes there just about every day. Every now and then she scores a good deal, table cloth, jacket or some other item. It's strictly hit or miss. They do have 50% off sales quite often. Worth checking out if you're in the area.","1294":"I was brought here by my coworkers. It's become sort of a ritual at my office to bring any new employees or out-of-town visitors here for lunch. Kind of a test of character. We usually go at least once a month.\n\nMy typical order is jerk chicken fried rice and egg foo yung with another varying meat option. I've tried the black beans and have to admit they're pretty good but I'm just not a big fan of lentils. I prefer having more rice.\n\nI love the egg foo yung. I dislike a lot of Americanized Chinese food dishes, but egg foo yung is one exception. My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top.\n\nI finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas. My coworkers swear by the Jade Red Chicken inside a quesadilla. A strange combination, but it's actually really good. I've heard that machaca inside a quesadilla is also good.\n\nFinally, who doesn't love a free snickerdoodle cookie?","1298":"Note: This review is strictly based on the food at Fresh and not the juices and such.\n\nFirst off I'm not a vegetarian but can appreciate a good vegetarian food when I have one and the food at Fresh was VERY bland (yes even for vegetarian food). \n\nI had the dragon bowl with the noodles and the sauce and vegetables and tofu had next to no taste (a little marinade with the grilling would go a long way). There was however some bean wrap (starts with a K) that was pretty tasty but that was pretty much it from the bunch of items we had on the menu. \n\nThe place looked alright, but was far too expensive for the sub-par food (my dragon bowl was just $14 for sub-par fast food almost). Not only that but maybe they should've moved the juicer to the back or got someone who knows how to juice considerably haha. The juicer man kept freaking the bejezus out of the whole restaurant everytime he stuck a fruit \/ vegetable in the juicer and the thing would give out this awful extremely loud noise that would shut the whole place up and it would become awkwardly quiet.\n\nAnyways I give this a 2 stars for expensive sub-par fast food, uninteresting (overdone) design, and food creation tactics. It seems the chain is just trying to catch on to the healthy vegetarian food craze and make as much money as they can while sacrificing originality and good food in the process.","1299":"The food was OK, but the wait was unbearable. 20 minutes to be seated, 15 minutes to be waited on, 30 minutes for the food to arrive. Hope you have a long layover. The table, chairs and floor was not especially clean either.","1301":"Id give a 3.5 closer to a 4.\nCustomer service is great, i called in my order and had my bf pick it up. Was very easy to order no issues straight to the point. Also when my bf picked up the food he told me how nice they were which is another plus. \nThe food is typical western chinese food. The one thing i loved mosy was the chicken balls was actually more chicken then dough. When does that ever happen lol. \nWe also got fried chicken wings also greasy and yummy . Just what i wanted fresh\/crispy.\nChicken fried rice was as expected no complaints.\nLastly the chilli chicken , which is why i said 3.5 and not 4. It was full of veggies barely any meat. Also was not spicey at all. But i guess its western chinese food and they know we cant handle spice lol","1304":"My stylist was very nice, and overall I was mostly happy with my experience. I used a Groupon and it wasn't stated there would be an additional fee for color for long hair. They made it up with a conditioning treatment which was great and I appreciate the offer. My stylist knew curly hair when I asked about it which was great because many salons don't and create huge issues. I think my questions made her a bit cautious though as the overall length was left a bit longer than I'd intended. The layers and thinning were done well though. Through no fault of their own they lost power halfway through the session. I chose to leave with my style half done because it felt awkward sitting around to see if it would come on, but they were very nice about it. I was offered something to drink several times. Overall I'd return which is a lot coming from me about a hair salon","1308":"Love this place for local Thai!  Great service.  Love the green curry and Mango tilapia .  Spring rolls are good and brown rice! ( just wish it wasn't an upcharge). I travel around and glad to have a local Thai pace. Pumpkin curry is great too!","1311":"I read the reviews and I am sorry to hear those people had a bad experience.  I work for the owner of an apartment complex in Scottsdale and Rainforest has done an outstanding job on all of our issues.  They are timely, they are much less expensive than our previous vendor, and they have fixed every problem they have been called out for.  I highly recommend them.","1314":"I gave this place two chances, both for brunch. Because I really want to like it...\nBUT\nBoth times the food was too greasy for me to eat, and both times the people I have been with, also did not enjoy their food. This last time one of my friends had to send his food back because it was too salty (the ham) and too greasy (the toast). They were nice about it and did not charge him. \n\nBOTH TIMES I have tried to convey something to the serving staff, in hopes that it gets to the kitchen- that food is greasy  and items are inedible. Twice the staff has cut me off mid-sentence, and responded that \"this is how item x is made,\" - as if customers were not eating at other restaurants (even the same dishes; something basic, like a hash brown!) without this trouble. \nSome perspective: paying customers should be able to order food that they can and want to eat, no matter what. Always. Even if it's fried. \nIt's understood some items on the plate are fried in fat, but the dish should not be unpleasant, revoltingly oily, even if it has a fried component. \nThe hash browns are literally, round oil sponges. Disgusting. \nThis is the oiliest brunch in town. Hands down. It's a shame because the space is so beautiful and open. \nIt feels like maybe in trying to do things in a unique way, they are ruining them... even the simple ones. \nI hope it changes!","1315":"They have organic items. I like that there is an organic produce section with organic veg and fruits. They sell locally grown sprouts. I like the bulk nut dispensers where there are some organic nut choices. They have a large selection of various ethnic foods and a section of Amy's organic frozen foods. They have canned organic beans. The store is big and beautiful. The staff is friendly and helpful. The parking lot is easy. As far as crime goes: I have not seen any. I know that recently a wanted man was across the street and apprehended on East Overlook , but if I didn't know that, I would not have seen it. The feeling is a nice grocery store.","1320":"Excellent burger and the best onion strings ever and a glass of wine. Atmosphere is cozy and very clean. Will definitely be back.","1321":"This is really the tale of two bars.  \n\nThe positive is that drinks are cheap and the food is pretty good.  I've had few things in my stops there and I haven't been disappointed by food yet.  The wings are fantastic, the sandwhichs are filling, and the sides are tasty.  \n\nI go here when i'm waiting my girlfriend to get home from work on mondays and the bartender monday sucks running.  She can't focus on more than one task at once and therefore is constantly flustered which makes for an uncomfortable air in the bar area. I've witnessed one of her meltdowns actually clear a pretty full bar.  Dear owner, this trainwreck is costing you money...you might want to consider upgrading staff.\n\nThe times she hasn't been there and a capable staffmember has been working has produced fun experiences.  That said, given the location it is what it is:  a yinzer bar bordering a less than desireable area of town and has everything that comes with it.","1324":"I read the previous reviews and seriously, what did y'all order?? I have been to Laredo over 6 times in 3 months and have had a very delicious, fresh and hot meal each time. My mom and I have eaten lunch and dinner there during on- and off-peak hours and have consistently good food. She is a very excellent cook herself and would tell the waiter if something was not to her liking. The salsa was perfect each time, with just the right amount of heat and spice, not overwhelmingly tomato-y or salty. In fact, I told the chef (who was leaving for the day) that I came from SF to have his salsa and he prepared a pound of FRESH chips and a pint of my favorite salsa to go, with a thank you note (he did this in less than 5 minutes). I've never had such consistently delicious food, great service, and wonderful dining moments in the area than at Laredo.","1325":"pretty good...love the burgers and the fries always hit the spot","1329":"Wow \nYou better be hungry to eat here \nPortions are massive \nWill not disappoint \nSit at bar and chat up with friendly bartenders \nBloody Mary a definite try","1333":"Great product of course but that is not the problem.  Cashiers!   Can your hire some?  I've been at this store three different times since thanksgiving and the lines are at least six people deep.   I put down my purchases and left.  I guess I am impatient but i would rather not wait that long.  Get your multi staff on the floor check out devices so that they can ring a customer out! Or add another register at the front.","1334":"This was a first time walk-in visit....casual atmosphere, you use an iPad to select your dishes, and how many of those dishes you want.  Food came very quickly....BE WARNED.....for a party of four, all of you have to have a la cart\/menu, two cannot have a la carte, and two menu.....Owner explained why we could not do this, and he was courteous about it and not rude, Customer Service was very good, attentive.  Food was really good and tasty, this is now one of our go to spots.","1339":"Bagel was passable but nothing to rave about. \n\nService was quick. \n\nThe place was filthy.  Drink station was a mess. The corners were full of grime.  Where it was critical to be clean it was but still it bugged me.","1342":"Don't think I'll go here again.  You have to push a broken intercom button to get service.  They tell you it will take a few days, but then never call you when to pick up the ashes.  The people were friendly, but service sucks.  I bought the middle grade package where they take a print of the dogs four feet, it was so rushed that its just one big blob (the dog was dead so it wasn't trying to pull its foot away).  It wouldn't even take an extra minute to have had a decent print made, I did pay extra for it.","1343":"When it comes to the usual Costco deals and weekly road shows, this Costco is fine, but there are two big problems with this store:\n\n1. In the last few months, the sample severs have gotten increasingly cranky and sometimes outright hostile. They have always been rude to my kids, who are generally polite, but today takes the cake. The server CHEWED out my son for touching one sample, then the other. Normally, that would be bad beahvior, but these were fully wrapped chocolates, not some greasy fish stick. The guy -- who was working the CHRISTMAS SECTION --  was so mad, I had to tell my son not to worry about it as we quickly walked away.\n\nAbout half of the servers at this store are polite enough, but NONE of them EVER SMILE.\n\n2. Even worse than the servers are the patrons, who are horrid creatures reminiscent of goblins from the Hobbit. Here are some examples:\n\n*One time, two elderly women started swearing at each other as they fought for the parking spot I was trying to vacate. One woman, whose husband was driving in circles on the opposite side of the parking lot, literally stood in the spot I left while the other tried to run her over. I wish I was exaggerating, but I had to roll up my windows so the kids couldn't here the exchange of swear words. \n\n*My kids have been shoved out of the way of samples as if they have no right to be there.\n\n*My kids have been rammed with carts by impatient shoppers who don't seem to understand that youngsters can get disorientated by the frenetic nature of that particular store. Heck, the traffic jams near the ready-to-eat chicken area can run 10-15 carts deep.\n\n*I've had customers literally push us out of the way to lay claim to some product or another.\n\nThe staff is okay at this store, which I've frequented since 2008, but they don't work as hard at being friendly or helpful compared with other stores I've visited. I don't know what, if anything, they can do about the bad customers, but it seems they should at least be aware that the Scottsdale store is out of control.","1345":"Staff was friendly, food was good, restaraunt was clean and beautiful !! Simple place,  you could tell they care for it their. I came on a solo-date (treat yoself??) And had a good time, their Thai tea tastes kind of funky but that's about the only complain I have. It wasn't bad just 'off'","1349":"One of the better chinese restaurants on the strip that are both delish and affordable . I would recommend the fried rice , spicy cucumbers and beef noodles","1351":"Nice little zoo and free and Could use more parking you can park on the street has 2 hour limit it worked for us the polar bear was  cool to see I would say if you live close to Madison go","1354":"Highs: Ambience, value, pizza and deserts. This is a genuine Italian grocery and I might shop here during the day when the crowds are smaller. The restaurant meals are cheap for what you get and word is out among the ASU students and young families. Pizza crust was chewy, crispy with just the right amount of char, like a good bread. Cannoli was outstanding, obviously had been freshly filled, as shell was perfectly crunchy and the sweet ricotta center had a nice clean flavor. Lows: Pasta and disorganization.  It was a packed Saturday night and they weren't prepared. The wine glasses and forks ran out. They had a weird ordering system where there were two cash registers, one halfway through the line. When one of the staff would become available they would open the halfway register, which meant that someone who was lucky enough to be there at that moment would get to order early, in effect cutting in front of the rest of us who had been waiting longer. Our ravioli and filled shells came out lukewarm. As Yogi Berra once said, \"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\"","1359":"Just got a haircut from Gondola and I am very satisfied and happy with the outcome. Showed the stylist the haircut I wanted and he did it very well. Forgot to ask his name but he is the stylist with shorter hair.  Cheaper than the salon I used to go and I use to pay $50 for just haircut and with Gondola, same satisfaction at a cheaper price. Will definitely come back again.\n\nGiving them 4 stars as stylist keeps on stopping while giving me haircut to pick up the phone since they don't have a receptionist.","1362":"Great dinner and service. Very reasonable menu and I would say one of the only place to eat on water st.","1372":"I grade sushi restaurants on 3 factors:\n- Quality - Excellent. No fishy smell on my food or in the restaurant. Delicious. Rolls were well made and tasty!\n- Quantity - I walked out STUFFED from eating the $9.99 lunch special.\n- Price - Can't beat $10 for lunch, especially this much good sushi.\n\nBut the takeout side of things was not as good.\nThe teeny tiny salad had wilted lettuce. The takeout version of the Sakana lunch does not include miso soup, although the price is the same, and they did not include chopsticks, napkins, or soy sauce.","1373":"I could write a review entirely refuting the poor reviews that HuHot has received on Yelp thus far. Instead, I'll focus on what I perceived to be an entirely fun and delicious dining experience. \n\nTo start, our waitress brought it to our attention that it was $1 Corona night. Not only that, but HuHot has a pretty decent selection of beers. Win. \n\nAs part of your meal, you get your choice of fried rice, white rice, or warm tortillas. Another addition to the all-you-can-eat meal was egg drop soup, which was very tasty. \n\nWe ordered crab rangoons for our appetizer - which the waitress said were made in-house - and they were pretty great. Enough so that I was a little bummed that there were only four rangoons to eat between the three of us. \n\nA unique selection of meat, veggies, and noodles makes up the main course. There are recipe cards at your table and as you approach the bar to help you make a decent little dish. If you trust your inner instincts as a cook, you'll do just fine without the cards when it comes to these areas. \n\nMind your sauces though. This is where things get a little tricky and can really make-or-break your dish. If you don't know your sauces, go with the cards. If you insist on winging it, there is a heat meter above the sauce area to help make sure your food isn't TuHot. \n\nBesides that corny joke, what's there really to complain about here? Our limes were a little on the old side on our first round of Coronas. The mushrooms were running a little low both times I ran through the line. The jalapenos were hotter than Hades.  Minor.  This was an enjoyable experience through and through.\n\nOh, and you get to watch your cooks try to do tricks with spatulas. What more can you possibly ask for? \n\nThis was my second time at HuHot, and I'll be back for more.","1374":"Well, time to find a new grocery. Maybe Bashas. Ever since Albertsons bought them, service has gone down hill. Not enough check out cashiers and they then get rid of the self check out lanes. What are they thinking. Every other retailer is going this route, Home Depot, Lowes, Wal Mart and even some restaurants have Kiosks on each table. I hope they rethink this marketing strategy. We have plenty of choices in the Valley. Frys and Bashas are just as close.","1375":"We came here one evening.  We were starving and not feeling like cooking.  I was pretty happy with my food.  I ordered from the menu that's above the cashier.  I can't complain about the portion size, it was a massive box of rice and 2 big meat kebob things.  I'm glad I read Bilal's review, because I asked about the white sauce and they gave it to me.  Also it was $9.99 + tax or something crazy.  I was stuffed!  I wish I could remember what it was called, but I think it was the second from the right and it started with an \"S\".  (I clearly should have taken a picture) or the menu.  One thing...they said it would be ready in 10 minutes, it took like 20.  I think they think it takes 10 but it doesn't.","1381":"We have a friendly little rabbit that we needed taken care of while we went on an 8-day vacation. There were a few options similar to Springbank Pet Resort, but I am glad we chose this place!\n\nWe dropped her off in the morning before our flight. They took us to the \"bunny and small animals room\" where we were allowed to set up her playpen, litterbox, and toys just the way we have it at home. The woman taking care of the small animals was extremely friendly and I felt good about leaving our bunny in her hands. We provided feeding instructions and they put labels on everything so our bag of food and hay wouldn't get mixed with someone else's. \n\nWe picked up our rabbit and she was ready to go for us, in great shape and seemed to be friendlier than when we dropped her off! They did a wonderful job and we will use this place again!\n\nPros: \n-Rabbits are only $12\/day (such a deal for piece of mind)\n-Friendly staff \n-Rabbits are kept in their own room away from barking dogs (lower stress).\n-Rabbit was in a good mood upon pickup and litterbox was cleaned for us.\n-Vet clinic next door (you can sign a waiver in case of medical emergency)\n\nCons:\n-The only con about this place was that the room where the small animals were being kept was not as clean as I think it should have been. When we set up our rabbit, the floors hadn't been mopped in a while and there were rabbit poops on the floor that I had to sweep myself.","1382":"The breakfast at egg works was amazing and they serve big portions! The potatoes were my favorite and the french toast was excellent! Definitely will be back!","1387":"Harlow's serves up a simple, thin crust pizza that gives you that real authentic Italian feel. They have a limited menu (a handful of pizzas and drinks, no substitutions allowed), but you are bound to get a good pie no matter what. My girlfriend and I got 2 pizzas (the margherita and the bianca), ate both, and left feeling satisfied without being stuffed. The pizza has a great, clean taste while staying light and fresh. The interior is just as fun and bright as the pizzas with a New Mexico feel (cacti and animal skulls with peach painted walls) and has a large front window they keep open when the weather is nice. Definitely stop by when you're looking for a nice light pizza.","1390":"Really great place. Went there on the advice of a friend, and now I'm a bit obsessed with Ron himself. \n\nSuch a character, and I mean that in the best sense of the word. He does great work, and always goes above and beyond. \n\nNot expensive at all, and your shoes come back looking perfect (actually, more than so). Got two heels replaced, and he even polished them up nicely before giving them back. \n\nSo taken with the experience that I wrote about Cecil's on my blog. (http:\/\/looksharpsconnie.blogspot.com\/2012\/05\/cecil-shoe-doctor.html)","1396":"Hole in the wall?  Basically there was a hole in the wall. I went in. They put me in a booth. Ordered lasagna. Not bad expensive. Not Italy lasagna but worth the price. All you can drink red or white wine l, Salad, garlic bread and Lasagna for $25.95. Not bad. Heck I would do it again.","1397":"The food was ok. I like the Miami location better. The atmosphere did not feel young and hip like the Miami location. The fried chicken was pretty tasty.","1398":"Ate here last night. Good east side spot. Awesome apps. Gourmet poutine and fois gras terrine were very good. Would have given 5 stars but the steak frites were just ok. Decent wine selection and great service & atmosphere. I would recommend it.","1402":"Sandwiches are so good! Pastries are a little heavy. \nLots of food with the combo, worth the price :-)","1405":"This place has a dang good Philly - which I should hope, since that's their game.  First time I went in the kid taking my order had no clue what he was doing, writing it down on a scrap of cardboard and severely lacking customer service skills.  But the sandwich came out great (and surprisingly, accurate).  Went in a second time a month or two later, and the gal was friendly and helpful - way better experience than the first time.  Again, the sandwich came out fantastic.  \n\nI found the prices to be reasonable as well, especially for a little mom-and-pop shop like this.  Definitely worth the stop, and next time I'm craving a Philly, this is where I'm headed.","1407":"We went for breakfast yesterday.  There was 4 of us and they offer 4 different vegan breakfast choices so we ordered one of each,  We often employ this strategy so we can try different things. The place seems borderline cheesy to me.  The service was over the top good but the quality of food and coffee not so much.  Of everything we tried the French Toast was the best of the lot!  They had some sort of sweet potato hash brown that was undercooked and the coffee was on par with the quality of a convenience store.  Bottom line - gimmicky place with good service, below average food and lousy coffee.  I will not be returning any time soon.","1408":"Another disappointing meal in Vegas :(.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes: har cherng, sui mai, har gow, cha siu bao, etc.\nYuck. Not good at all.. (I forgot to take pictures because we were so hungry that we just dug into the food right away.) It didn't taste fresh, and the dumpling skin wasn't very soft. The sui mai looked OLD. I eat dim sum quite frequently and this was nowhere near the standards for dim sum in LA! \n\nThe best thing was probably the boiled Chinese broccoli dish (which tastes the same everywhere) and cha siu bao (but I've still had better). Gr.. Eating such horrible dim sum just made me crave better Chinese food in LA. \n\nService: It was difficult to find a server to refill our drinks and give us our check. However, the workers are friendly and \n\nNote: It's located inside Gold Coast Casino. Some advice? Come early! This place isn't too big and there was a line when we arrived around 12:30pm until we left the restaurant a little before 2.","1410":"The service is good for a very busy Chinese restaurant. They gave you a lot of food for the price. All the food item we ordered are above average. I love the fact that they have revolving door, so that the cold does not come in when people go in and out; and they also have a large waiting area which is really a life safer when you have to wait for 20 min with the deep freeze outside.","1415":"Interesting that this place closed. The one in Jersey where I lived was packed at all times. I can say perhaps it was the youngsters working here with the attitude of not wanting to serve. Walked in and was the only person there and I could see that I was clearly an annoyance. Not just the waitress but even the person behind the counter -I suppose he was the cook? Food was ok but customer Service is probably what caused this location to close.","1417":"We used to love this location and always went! We visited tonight and it was pretty messy. Some of the machines were broken, they didn't have any chocolate or peanut butter yogurt, only the ice cream chocolate. The area was overall messy looking and they don't always have the best flavors in stock. Used to love going here and hopefully it gets better!","1422":"Finally, a night spot that doesn't feel like old-Calgary, or drunk and slutty Calgary. I've hit up Commonwealth a couple of times and I'm diggin' the digs. Larger bar upstairs, more clubby atmosphere downstairs or lounge in the front, you've got your pick.\n\nThis isn't a spot to come for dinner, no siree. But for nibblets and some yummy bourbon cocktails (me and bourbon are new found friends since last August), colour me sold, Commonwealth is a place I hope to find myself more often.\n\nYou'll want to try the apple something cocktail. I can't remember the full name, but it's got ginger in there somewhere and it's AWESOME. The shrimp loaf thing is also quite tasty, as are the spring roll taquito bits and the sliders.\n\nDecor, well, I think you should go have a look for yourself... keep an eye out for the stuffed crows.\n\nYelp's 30 Day Challenge: 29\/30","1426":"I was not impressed and the food was fair and I spend a lot of money. The place was very busy and cold. I will not return soon.","1428":"I'm not a vegetarian, in fact I'm more of a meat-etarian... But I would recommend this place to those who like to dine vegetarian..\n\nMom told me a few of her friends recommended this place, so I guess she wanted to go..\n\nMade a RSVP for Friday night, parking was full and place was packed, so we waited 15 minutes.\n\nSat down and ordered a few dishes which we accustomed to and also ordered some unfamiliar dishes recommend by Yelp users.\n\nOverall the food was very good. Although I'm not into this type of food, I could tell it was pretty well cooked, props to the kitchen!! \n\nOnly complaint is the food came pretty slow considering we came later in the evening and by the time we got seated, the place was half empty..\n\nI personally wouldn't come back here for dinner unless if someone wanted to go or if I had to accommodate vegetarian friends - just because I prefer meat and seafood.. \n\nBut I would come back to try their dim sum dishes, as they look delicious and I have faith in the kitchen.\n\nEven though it's not my cup of tea, I believe this place deserves 4 stars","1429":"My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. \nI returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone.","1430":"Don't get me wrong....nice place & good shopping. But no place to park!!! Valet has roped off more & more space which sit mostly empty. Or drive in circles searching searching. Kinda shitty to have to park at a place where you are already going in to drop $$$","1431":"I don't get the allure of this place. Average food and somewhat overpriced. Service good but not great. Many better restaurant choices in the Montrose area for sure!","1435":"Excellent service and extremely rich tasting food, Guy has taken sports bar food to a new level of decadence. I had the Triple T fries and 14-hour Brisket sandwich. The meal was heavily portioned. The truffle oil laden fries were topped with minced garlic, cheese, and cilantro. The brisket was fall apart tender on top of Texas toast, abundantly garnished with cabbage. The mixed fries accompanying the brisket were like hot thick BBQ chips, delicious. Ashley made our experience perfect, attending to our wants and needs, making great suggestions, and patient. My suggestions though are to order margaritas or the ginger mint cocktail to temper the creamy robust and overwhelming at times. Please share because the tastes are to strong to eat the same dish for 30 minutes, mix it up and prepare for large portions.","1441":"I don't give too many onesies and twosies, but I believe this place merits it on one main level that trumps the modern high ceilings, giant photos of good looking sushi and the staff who get something for effort. \n\nThe real issue here on two specific occasions is this; I was attracted by all the ads and photos of their somewhat new Temari offering. It stands for \"hand ball\" or the like and are rice balls either stuffed, mixed or topped with various ingredient combinations. \n\nIn sum it adds up to this; too expensive for the lack of quality ingredients in the 4 balls themselves. The photos are quite misleading and in the case of the crispy lobster balls is virtually faux...where's the beef comes to mind...pretty much lobster rillettes at best. \n\nI think you can read between my overt lines that I was really disappointed times two.","1444":"Nice service, reasonable prices, and better\/more interesting flavour than the average TO Indian food restaurant.  Was hesitant to try a roti place because I cannot eat wheat; however, they were more than happy to accommodate.  \n\nNot a place to take a first date, because the decor is a bit boring.","1446":"Looking for a place to drink and chit-chat in downtown after work. Bar Hop Brewco might be another good choice for you. They offer 36 in-house brewed beers and almost 100 bottle beers. Their yummy snack are only $5-$9. This Bar Hop Location is their 2nd location located on Peter street. Luckily, they have a roof-top patio.\u00c2\u00a0 So it will be perfect for a sunny day.  However, we came here when it was still cold  and they haven't opened their patio yet.\n\nIt was our first time for this location.\u00c2\u00a0 We came late night on Sunday few weeks ago.\u00c2\u00a0 It was around 11 pm and it was packed!\u00c2\u00a0 No one seemed to want to leave the place early .\u00c2\u00a0 We waited for 15-20 mins before we got a chance to sit at a barrel table.\u00c2\u00a0 We actually had a barrel table when we got in.\u00c2\u00a0 A waiter suggested us to wait at the barrel table close to their bar but two guys who came in after us just walked there and sat right away when they saw it.\u00c2\u00a0 Ya..they saw us too but who cares right? They were pretty drunk before they even got in there.\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't want to argue with them because I dint think they could understand anything at that time .\u00c2\u00a0 So we just stood there and waited for another barrel table.\u00c2\u00a0 We ordered beers to start with and waited for almost another half an hour for a real table  that we could sit and eat.\u00c2\u00a0 I'm a big eater!\u00c2\u00a0\n\nFood\n Appetizer\n - My luv  \"Pan Seared Mushrooms\"  It was delicious!\u00c2\u00a0 They were roasted with garlic and glazed with\u00c2\u00a0 porter  It was a generous portion with a $5 price.\u00c2\u00a0 If you love mushroom, you would love it! \n - Pork Cracklings\u00c2\u00a0  One word \"Huge!\"  And only $5.\n - BBQ Tertilla Chips $5 was worth money for its portion.\u00c2\u00a0 It was also good with beers.\n\n Main\n - Fried Chicken Sandwich $15.\u00c2\u00a0 It was fine for us but nothing was special.\u00c2\u00a0 We'd prefer big puffy butter fried chicken sandwich \n\nAtmosphere\u00c2\u00a0\n - Atmosphere was great and clean. The main floor was decorated with wood and beer barrels.\u00c2\u00a0 It was cozy but they have limited seats if they don't open their patio.\n\nService\n -\u00c2\u00a0 Understand that its hard to expect a good service in bars.\u00c2\u00a0 However, Bar Hop always has a good name on its good service at the original location on King street.\u00c2\u00a0 So they catch up on that for this location too.\u00c2\u00a0 I saw two waiters running around the bar.\u00c2\u00a0 I wasn't sure if they short of staff!?\u00c2\u00a0 I hope they have more staff next time we come by.\n\nOVERALL Experience :  We definitely come back! It is very close to my husband's work place  only 2-3 minutes walk.","1449":"I have to start this by saying my first trip to Doan's was 3.5\/4 star material - slow service but friendly, I enjoyed a delicious veg\/tofu pho (in a beef broth) and my dining companion ordered a bun with nicely flavored meats and a pretty good spring roll on top - but my second visit made me wonder.\n\nI was out with my sister when we realized we were hungry, and were in the mood to have a beer or glass or wine with dinner, I couldn't remember if Doan's was serving yet so I called while on the road and a woman informed me they do sell beer and wine, but not liquor. Worked for us. My sister is also a vegetarian and although I couldn't remember if I saw a veg section in the menu, we did find one online so we figured we were safe, and then we arrived... First, our waitress informed us they don't serve alcohol yet. Um, okay? After a ridiculous wait to get someones attention to ask if they had a veg menu supplement, we were informed by a waiter that they used to, but have since chucked it. Great. Unfortunately he was unwilling to point us in any direction or give us any veg friendly options. Okay, back to the menu.\n\nI ordered the rocket shrimp and the bun with chik\/pork\/springrolls (after they informed me they don't serve the banh xeo listed on their menu). My sister ended up ordering the wonton soup with tofu\/veg and the tofu\/veg pad thai. My food was fine, but for her, she ended up with a plain wonton soup and the seafood pad thai. If it hadn't taken so long to get the first round of food she would have sent it back, and the waitress was very grateful she didn't want to send it back and that she agreed to pick around the seafood and eat the dish. My sister then asked for a few steamed veggies on the sides to supplement the lack of vegetables in her pad thai, the waitress agreed without issue. \n\nEverything seemed okay, though the veggies arrived in a completely different sauce, but when we got the bill I was a little surprised. Not only did we have to pay for the seafood pad thai that we clearly did not order (and all the seafood was left stacked on the side of the plate), we also had to pay for the side of vegetables! seriously?? It was only a few dollars more in the end, but included with the lack of service (in a fairly empty restaurant), there are just better places in town to get great tasting Vietnamese food with better service. Sorry Doan's, maybe next time.","1450":"We were fans of Flat Top but now like this better because you don't have to wait so long for your food.  You have to stand there while they cook it but for some reason this seems faster than sitting at your table.  They have a wider variety of food and meat than Flat Top also and because they have the two sides of the buffet open with the same choices, you don't feel as rushed with people crowding you.\n\nThe kids love it.  We like to get the tortillas and they are a little slow bringing those - they give you only 3 at a time and when the whole group is using them, they don't go very far.  \n\nHuHot is really a bargain for kids - I think that it's $5 for all you can eat.  Oh, that's another benefit - you can go up and get more at any time.","1451":"Great noodle spot! I love the vibe and friendly service. I forgot what the dish is called but I got the beef with vegetables and noodles. It was amazing, after a long day at work and you feeling asian food come here. Decent wait time for food, knowing that it's freshly made noodles made the wait worth it. My dish also came a little soup which was a good pairing. I tried the soup my acquaintance ordered and found it quite salty which was weird because it looked like the same broth that came with my dish. Maybe it was the meat? The environment itself was ok, when it gets busy it's super cramped. I found the main wooden soup spoon way too big for my mouth. I think that spoon was made for Matt Stonie or Kobayashi. Overall good food, good service!","1452":"On their way to shutting down and I can see why. This place is overpriced even with the 10-30% closeout discounts plus I've never been into a Sports Chalet and had a good customer service experience. The staff always acts like they're way to busy to say hello, smile or help anyone with anything. Not sad to see this place go. Surprised they've been open this long....","1454":"I've worked in this mall. I've been kicked out of this mall. I've hung out at this mall. I've shopped at this mall. I have early childhood memories of this mall. Mall mall mall, mall mall... mall. \n\nYet another Westcor joint... this place has gone through many facelifts and is set to go through yet another soon. I don't really shop here much anymore, but I find it to be very easy to navigate and park at and find exactly what I want. \n\nI get a very nostalgic feeling from this place whenever I go. Usually years go by between visits and I'm always surprised both at seeing the new stores and changes made as well as how much it has stayed the same. Most of my favorite stores have long split the scene. No matter how much things change here or what comes or goes, there's always something for everyone here. \n\nI suppose when I'm 70 if I still live here in the valley, I'll probably start walking around the mall at 5am until it opens... do they still do that? I don't know.","1462":"Very much a \"diner,\" but good good food. Can't wait to sit on the patio in the spring.","1463":"Don't get me wrong the 1 stars reviews are correct and accurate,  but knowing that in advance and the dirt cheap price made it worth while.  The sheets were clean and and the plumbing works.  As a place to crash for cheap I can recommended it.  If you are bothered by dirty floors and a place that is in almost complete disrepair, then spend much more to stay somewhere else. I stayed here for two nights and was happy.","1467":"I'm in love with their vegan pizza...soy sausage, BBQ sauce, and red onions, oh my! My only complaint is the crust...it's not great...sometimes I think it tastes like cardboard (that's why 4 stars and not 5). The toppings definitely make up for it though. I'm not sure what the crust is missing, but I wish it was better (or maybe not because then I'd be ordering pizza more often!!).\n\nWe have never been there in person--always gotten delivery. The delivery is fast...usually around 45 minutes. Once they forgot my soy sausage and the replacement pizza was here in 20 minutes. Great service!","1482":"Looking for some incredibly specific and overpriced kitchen gadget? Sur La Table is your best chance of finding it. Whether you need a ceramic ginger grater, a battery-powered pepper mill, or just a new knife, it's probably hiding somewhere in amongst the jumbles of kitchen implements here.\n\nIt's lots of fun to browse, but if you're in a hurry, it's best to ask one of the staff to help you find whatever you're looking for--otherwise, you could easily waste a half hour. Luckily, most of the employees seem fairly knowledgable about what's in stock and which fondue pot it's hiding behind. Compared to the Williams Sonoma over at La Place in Beachwood, Sur La Table has a better selection, better prices, and better staff.\n\nStill, I'll generally stop here only if I'm in need of something quickly or just feel like looking around. If you can wait a few days, it's almost always a good bit less expensive to order whatever you need from Amazon or some other online retailer.","1492":"Modified my previous review after the store owner's thoughtful response to feedback shared. I respect small business owners that put in effort to follow up to feedback shared. After his note, I have gone back to the business and better understand what their focus areas are. \n\nSUMMARY\nCheese & Crackers primarily is an order ahead market. The name 'cheese and crackers' is misleading, as what they offer stretches beyond cheese. You can order a range of things like artisanal cheese trays, cured meats to seafood. The trick is to visit their website and sign up for their mailing list. There, you'll get a better feel for the range of products Cheese & Crackers offers on a weekly basis beyond what you just see in-store. \n\nPROS:\n- Order Seafood: They have a mailing list to order fresh seafood. Sign up on their website. They bring in fresh, high quality seafood from Canada. I went to a dinner party that served fresh salmon from here - was delightful. \n- Catering: They are a great fit for catering, in particular artisanal cheese platters and trays. \n- Baguette Sandwiches To Go: They serve sandwiches on baguettes like thinly sliced roast beef.\n- Cheese Assortment: They have an extensive list of featured cheeses.\n\nCONS: \n- They don't offer in-store or to-go cheese plates - only order ahead. I would love to be able to stop by, select 3-4 cheeses, take them home to try that evening. \n- They have a few bistro tables, but the store footprint is small thus it isn't really a spot to hang out in-store. \n- The sandwiches are only served on baguettes, and the baguettes are really tough on your teeth \/ hard to bite. Would be nice to offer another bread option for sandwiches, as the sandwiches are very tasty.","1493":"I stopped in here the other night before a movie, without having done any research or prior yelping, which is very unusual and risky for me! The menu is vast, and prices pretty decent for the area, selection, and ambiance. I had the drunken noodles with beef and a HUGE portion was delivered. Tender wide rice noodles arranged on a bed of fresh veggies, wood ear mushrooms, lettuce, and flavorful beef. Around $13 w\/ tax + tip I believe, quite the bargain and provided me with leftovers! Would go back if I was in the area.","1495":"Cute place. Lots of color choices. My nails were shaped and painted nicely, but my nail tech cut me, drew blood and didn't even apologize. He was hurting me when he was cutting the cuticle on one of my toes and when I asked him to stop he didn't... he ended up drawing blood. He then left me with dried blood on my manicure. Gross. I had to go back and ask someone to fix it. They were nice but made me wait and ended up not being able to fix it. They literally let me walk out bleeding and with dried blood on my polished toe, gave me polish to put on it later and let me pay full price for the pleasure. The rest of my nails look nice which I'm appreciative of, but disappointed about a bloody pedicure from a place with all these rave reviews. The next day my whole cuticle looks injured and I'm left with a decent size, gross looking scab. Oh well. I guess I'll just keep looking for a go-to pedi place. Be careful if you go here.","1496":"Good flavors, good entrees.  Sometimes it's not entirely clear which style a dish is going to be in, which can lead to interesting mishmashes.  Friendly service.  9\/10 ... Given what it is.","1500":"Oh boy. I love giving proactive reviews but this place has made that hard. Sadly I live nearby writhing in pain having to be so honest. Premium pricing with poor execution. The good - prosecco cold, server kind and considerate. The bad - bills couldn't be separated, pasta with seafood was strangely citrus and unItalian. Pizzas bland, calamari average with a strange paste base. Server did not know menu items to recommend. \n\nOverall - the place has a great setting and almost everyone we know including us find it has been consistently poor value for what you pay. \n\nNeeds help.","1501":"The only reason why I would venture into the Desert Passage shops at Aladdin.  They carry the largest assortment of BCBGirls clothing.  Of course, they also carry the pricier collection, BCBG.\n\nI love their wide range of price points.","1503":"Ok so last time I went they nailed all the dishes-except maybe that weird parmigiano-sour chicken wing dish- not a fan but I was very impressed especially since the last two visits food was uneventful- I think they got new kitchen crew so that's a good thing now","1510":"The food was good but overall I would suggest finding somewhere else. The service was a little slow, the food was alright but not amazing (and we are in Phoenix, don't settle for mediocre). It felt like a chain restaurant.\n\nOn the upside, it might be good for large groups.","1513":"Ordered a single KYB AGX strut from Vivid. They had the best price shipped to CA  online so I thought I'd give them a try. There was a minor problem with my paypal account but Vivid was quick to email me about it and also quick to fix the problem. Item arrived promptly and in good condition. Very satisfied with their service and communication. Would not hesitate to order from them again.","1515":"Had an egglslut and a gaucho... pretty good for brunch but not enough to fill.  Also had to wait in line for 30 minutes-- should've gotten there earlier, oh well!  A good mid morning snack.","1517":"I love Marie Callender's and this one didn't disappoint me.  The service was very quick and super friendly.   The food is great and the portions are good.   Eating here is always a good value and here it was a good experience.","1523":"Place looks pretty cool  barbers are friendly have never gotten a cut from here I have only been going for product  but am planning on going one day soon","1534":"I loved my pulled pork sandwich. It was very very good ! they have a spicy vinegar sauce, Carolina style which I really appreciate . However I always eat my pulled pork with coleslaw. I ordered Carolina style.... It was horrible! I had a half inch of vinegar floating at the bottom of my cup. Totally turned me off. However there are several other side  dishes. I  know what to not try again, but I certainly will come back here. The barbecue was phenomenal.","1538":"I NEVER eat at Extreme Pita. After a bout of food poisoning many, many years ago...I have been so turned off by it. However, while visiting with my sister over the weekend we figured we should have a quick bite to eat before venturing out on our errands. We stopped in here as it was close by, and I was super impressed! We were greeted with friendly smiles. The place was SPOTLESS, including the bathroom, which I did use. We shared a veggie pita and it was really good, all of the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. The only downside was the really strong onion smell on my hands after washing them repeatedly! I am happy to say that I am no longer afraid of Extreme Pita =)","1541":"Sadly, you have need to come here unless you have a specific reason to be here, or you like looking at abandon shops inside of a small mall.\n\nThere are a handful of stores inside and a school- you know your mall is failing when it becomes a church or a school. There are a few bars, but nothing major. Again, I feel like only people staying at the hotel next to it would visit here only because it's so close.\n\nNow there are a few other restaurants outside of the mall like The Hard Rock Cafe and Texas De Brazil, but nothing really catches your eye as a place you really want to stop at.\n\nThe Ducky Tour begins and ends there so there is that. What's sad is the area itself is kind of nice. They installed that beautiful fountain that plays to music, like the Belliago in Vegas, but with much less flare.\n\nIt's upsetting because this could be an amazing place, but it just isn't. You don't need to come here if you're visiting, spend your time at more interesting places because there are a ton in the city.","1542":"My boyfriend and I were excited to try this restaurant because it is very close to where we live. We were hungry for a late dinner and ordered some food to go to bring back home. The food was ready in about 15 minutes and everything was great! \n\nWe are mostly veggie eaters so we each tried the falafel wrap, which was excellent. The falafel was crispy and warm, grilled with veggies in a pita wrap. The wraps came with a fresh cucumber sauce that we put on the wraps, a great addition. We tried the tabouli, which was also fresh and delicious. We also shared a spinach + feta pie from the appetizer section. \n\nThis was a LOT of fresh food for a great price, we will definitely be going back. Highly recommended.","1547":"Bought a used 2012 Mazda Speed 3 from this dealer today. I traded in my car as well. The dealership overall I am giving 4 stars, I would give Matt, my salesman, 5 stars for him alone. \n\nI found the vehicle online after several days of searching for the right car to trade mine in for. I called and made an appointment to test drive the vehicle. I arrived early but was greeted and offered refreshment immediately. Really loved the vehicle and started negotiating. Basically told them what I wanted and could do and they met me exactly there without any issue. They also gave me more for my trade in than anyone else had offered. It took a long time to get with the finance manager and that part was the only real detractor from the experience. \n\nI did notice the typical extra items they could have tried to tack on and it sounds like from other reviews they sometimes try to add that stuff on, but if you give them the bottom line and have confidence knowing what you need in your vehicle, probably won't be a problem.\n\nI highly recommend this dealer.","1556":"I've been to Snug on numerous occasions, and I do enjoy my time when I go! However, I believe that the menu does need an update. For the prices they are serving, and the beautiful location, the food is not on par. The crab cakes are amazing, and I've had my fair share of fish, steak, ahi tuna, good but not amazing. \n\nCome for a good meal and beautiful location, but after being there many times, menu needs an update! I hope the chefs see this! Hope they are not cutting corners.","1560":"After spending the day at Woodbine Beach, I was looking for a good burrito place within decent walking distance to share with friends. Luckily, Burrito Bandidos was not too far a walk, and it certainly did not disappoint. \n\nI ordered a large Mango Chicken burrito, complete with everything, short of jalapenos. I waited around 5 minutes for the order to be completed, which seemed shorter than most of the reviews here. (Although, most of them seem outdated.) The chicken was fairly juicy and tender, and the ingredients tasted fresh. My only complaint would be that the mango chicken was around a dollar more than the regular chicken, and the only thing you got were roughly julienne-d apple mango slices. Nice, tangy addition, but not worth the extra cost in my opinion. \n\nI would drop by again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. 4\/5","1568":"Food is basic Italian and comes with all you can drink wine, but it's around 30 bucks per person.  Not worth it...","1569":"I don't understand the negative reviews for this place, I really like the pho and in terms of customer service I have never had an issue. The best thing about this place is the actual noodles they use. It has a great chewy texture. The broth has good flavour and it is good value. Also the fresh shrimp roll had tons of filling including different herbs. It is on my regular rotation of pho places.","1573":"I borrowed a friends Costco card with the sole purpose of purchasing the Cackalacky Cheerwine bbq sauce, little did I know I would walk out spending over $100. I love Costco just as much as I love Sams. I am seriously considering getting my own membership to have both. While both sold the same type products, the options did vary at both. Where I found a variation of 1 item at one that the other did have. After walking into Costco i'd felt i'd been missing out on awesome deals.","1576":"Great place to hang out, such a cute interior! The bingsu is okay. I really like the red bean paste :)","1582":"Went to the White Brick Kitchen three times in the past 2 months. Twice for dinner and once for Sunday brunch. Absolutely love this place! \n\nWe had the buttermilk half chicken ($17), green beans (special side, changes often. Added $3 on top of chicken) and sloppy joe fries ($14). The portions are really big. I packed a doggy bag from dinner both times. The buttermilk chicken is so crispy and fresh. You can choose to make the chicken spicy for an additional $2. We didn't do that because I'm not into spicy food.  The green beans were baked with cheese on it, which was unique and delicious. The joe fries were really good. They did not skim on the ingredients. A lot of meat! The sunny side up egg was a nice touch. This dish has a kick so beware non-spicy eaters! \n\nThe second time I went for dinner, I had the chicken again and a side of cider slaw. The chicken is always good and the slaw wasn't bad. I also had a toffee pudding cake with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but rich and tasty. Good to share with 2 people. \n\nOverall, dinner was great. Only complaint was that the food did take about 20 mins to come both times. I think it's because the chicken was made to order so beware of this if you are on a time constraint. Definitely worth the wait though. \n\nThe brunch is only available on Sundays. We had the turkey croissant (special item, changes weekly, I believe. About $14, can't remember exact amount), Scottish eggs ($10) hickory bacon ($4) and homemade ginger beer. Everything was so fresh and flavourful! Loved the brunch here!\n\nThe food is on the pricier side, about $25 to $30 a person for dinner and $15 to $20 for brunch, but you pay for what you get here. Totally worth it. Service is okay. Only two waiters working when we went so it was a bit slow, but they were all super friendly! Will be coming back here again! One of my fave American food places for sure!","1592":"I come here when I'm in the mood for some fast food that is seemingly pretty healthy. I usually order the same thing... The chicken bowl. I get it with brown rice. Usually brown rice can be in general grainier than white rice. However, I never really notice that at chipotle which is a plus. The chicken can be a bit charred or dry sometimes but it's normally not a problem. I also get the fajita veggies. However, the veggies can be a hit or miss for me. I normally like my veggies more the in the saut\u00c3\u00a9ed side but sometimes they can be more crunchy and raw for my taste. I love their corn salsa so I tell the person to like that stuff on my bowl. I do notice that this location does tend to give me a little smaller portion than at other locations.","1593":"I don't normally review chain places anymore but I'll say this -- this Taco Bell isn't that good as far as Taco Bells go. I don't know why but some ingredients -- especially anything with rice -- tastes awful. I don't know if the Taco Bell\/KFC's use a different ingredient base but I can't believe how bad things like the Cheesy Bean and Rice burrito taste. Other than that, it's Taco Bell..what's to say?","1594":"Our friends live in the Strip District of Pittsburg. When we visited them last fall between weddings in DC & NY, we had fun exploring the area. We were only there for a few nights and it was in the middle of the week so we didn't get the full deal, but the strip is still worth checking out, regardless of what day it is. If we go back to Pittsburg, we'll try to go between Fri & Sun to get in on all the action. After reading some of the other reviews it sounds like we missed out.  We still had fun and we recommend checking it out.","1596":"Since it's called \"Number One,\" I was expecting to be impressed. This was my first experience with pho and if this is indeed number one, pho must be a very overrated food. The beef and pork seemed to be low quality. Most of the restaurant surfaces were covered in grime like one would find above an oven. The floors were sticky all over. The service was friendly but overall the experience was a disappointment. It takes more than an important name to make a restaurant number one.","1597":"Every time I visit Las Vegas, I always stop by some some nachos supreme, they are so gooooood. The hot sauce is also great! The place is a little small and outdated but the service is always pleasant! The Cali burrito and mozzarella sticks are also great! Give this place a try!","1599":"Very tasty food and nice seating arrangements. Only thing is the food can be a bit greasy - but I guess that's a given with nachos\/ burgers\/fries\/etc.","1607":"We were leaving a wedding banquet and saw this food truck across the street. So happy that we stopped here! The tacos were amazing and on point! There is a hot dog stand right next to it, which we decided to try one since we are never on the side of town (live in Henderson area) the hot dog was delicious as well!! Highly recommended! It was busy when we got there but the service was good and we got our food fast ( from taco truck and hot dog stand). Will go back to both places if we are ever are on this side of town again. :)","1612":"Very much enjoyed the pedicure I got here last week - the staff was friendly and professional and my nail tech did a great job. My only complaint is that I could not find a list of services and prices beforehand and therefore did not know how much I would be paying.","1613":"Great food, great atmosphere, really cool view of the pools in the patio area, and great service. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because of the price. I know it's vegas, but 17$ for a chicken quesadilla is a bit much.","1614":"Every time I eat here I am never disappointed. The food is delicious, the staff are friendly, and overall is always a great experience. Their house specialty, the shaken beef, is an absolute must to try. Definitely give Saigon Kitchen a visit if you're in the neighborhood.","1616":"This place looks like your college dorm cafe with nice decorations. Many variety of food to pick from. Like other post, it is limited on desserts. The highlight of this buffet is their noodle bar, king crab & shrimp cocktail and their PRIME RIB. WOOAH. Service was ok.","1618":"I've been coming to this location for over 20 years and the service and food have always been fantastic.\n\nWe came here the other night because I had a craving for crab legs. I had the 1lb snow crab legs but instead of having the corn and red potatoes that come with the dish, I opted for the roasted mixed vegetables and a garden salad. My husband selected from a four-course special they were offering and chose cheese and broccoli soup, a caesar salad, shrimp and scallop linguine and the caramel cheesecake for dessert.\n\nEverything I've ever had at this restaurant has been delicious and tonight was no exception. The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable albeit quite a bit more dimly lit than it used to be... you can still see your food, just not the person you're dining with (I kid!) and although the restaurant was relatively full, it was surprisingly quiet.\n\nOverall, a wonderful dinner and I will continue to come here."}}
